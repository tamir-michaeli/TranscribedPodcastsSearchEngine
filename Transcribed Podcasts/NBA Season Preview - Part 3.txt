NBA Season Preview - Part 3
on Today Show we start things off by debating which NBA front-office have the Summers best offseason what's the meme of the summer who will win 6 man of the year are the Pelicans better without Boogie is the toughest part 3 of the starter 50 burning questions three of the starters NBA season preview actually I was burning questions about the upcoming NBA season Miss Parts one or two what's wrong with you go catch up on YouTube but let's keep this party going here guys to question number 21 overall it's a good one which team had the best offseason he got the best player in the game you win the offseason it's the Lakers and LeBron James and he signed a four-year deal surprising everybody and sign in for that for your deal also means they could have the best offseason next year because that's attractive for a kawaii or another free agent to say all this guy's going to be there for another few years and it's so much different than the way Cleveland it was always easier to hear what we do to keep around what do we do to impress him and show him that we're headed the right direction we might have been planning this sort of thing the next star after Kobe Bryant's is before Kobe left it didn't work out with why it didn't work out with LaMarcus Aldridge Carmelo Anthony LeBron even at the end of the prime of his for a little bit of internal conflict can't get a player like Kawhi Leonard you go out and you do it even if it's possibly for a 1-year rent at you have to make that loop I think you saw Sam presti with Paul George lassos and took that Gamble and it did pay off I think I massage Erie realize that he had to do the same thing because it was a fantastic player for the LeBrons going to the western conference conference is but a veteran presents very good Defender and can shoot 3-point and also brings the right attitude to that same doctor argue wraps get to Kauai I think a team front office I guess they had maybe an underrated season is the Indiana Pacers and it's not as flashy is LeBron required I get that but they went out and made some solid solid additions in free agency in unit to hopefully expand on that 48 wins that they had last year and I'm talking about guys like Tyreke Evans comes in great for the last year Doug McDermott 22 million it's a little pricey but it's going to do some shooting as a back of a million-dollar do I like those Edition I know that you liked that they got in the draft I got a backup guard in Aaron holiday another holiday bro in this league at 23 overall that's all it off season for a team that like I said one for you and they quietly have to Max spots available next summer because a bunch of guys having only one year deal and I got a bunch of guys like that is selling all coming off the book basically it's Victor Oladipo and Doug McDermott that are really signed long-term contracts they can make somebody wants to go play with where was it made me want to play Thursday Indiana to work question who wins the 2018-19 Sixth Man of the Year award for our very early predictions a tough one to protect I found but I just talked to him legal is Kyle kuzma with the Lakers Tasco is Julius Randle for 6 man we already talked about him for a possibility give it to Sweet Lou Williams of the coverage yes I am saying he's going to go back there in New Orleans but let's get to align hits 3s he puts up a good 20-25 feels like every night at least when he's born to do proper that also feels right to me I think you will be coming off the bench for the Pelicans because they only have one non shooter starting an offer Peyton you don't want to go out there again with Anthony Davis getting some room u.s. 60 and eight last year he started a bunch 60 + 8 + majan those numbers coming off the bench they will expect him to score a lot cuz that plays hard he can distribute these in the perfect scenario to win 6 man of the year he wants to see how the God who can actually get their own shot or at least create a little bit of the last year as a rookie shot 37 how far is buddy but he knows how to get pocket and I like the way you hold a the Swagger that he takes out on the court as well soccer game last year I think he's going to be it's a mansion amarily receive Tyreke Evans go into the Pacers I think is in the mix for 6 man of the year he was great like you said in that role with Memphis last year we had all the shots he wanted basically 19 five and five 45% shooting three ball last year Indiana Hill play the Victor Oladipo roll really Off the Bench cases for 22nd and bench scoring last year so there are games for the Pacers alongside Oladipo two guys with Cummins play all right next question it's a classic here on the starters what's your pun tastic New York Post headline for this season we got to predict the future when it comes to the post headlines the pain after his favorite rapper Fabolous but I think the Knicks season in New York it's going to be a hard knocks life or Kevin if he is going to have a good year out there things are not going to go well for Kevin Knox in the New York Knicks probably it's already been done. I'm doubling down on my PS4 50 prediction from last year I still believe Tim Hardaway Jr can do this last year get a couple games or Helix 35 34th and a half I never once I still believe sad instead of Tim bombs away Junior that's what I was last year the Russian army use the same headline as last year actually the same three flags Batman Beyond the return Italy up down report debate whether or not it's okay is down down is Upworthy Uptown report we have 4 more burning questions as part of our NBA season preview hear let's hear from you guys on Twitter hashtag the starters thumbs-up or thumbs-down first one guys are you up or down on the Pelicans being better without DeMarcus Cousins here for an entire season now and moving on to the Warriors they Thrive but we don't know what they could have become with Boogie cousins I think they couldn't make a move to sign into a long-term deal because I've had so many misses on the wing they're so desperate to pair a wing with Anthony Davis injury holiday in which makes a lot of sense so you couldn't pay Biggie Biggie Biggie Biggie and faith and Anthony Davis up front when they have so much money and other guys so I make sense what they're doing but I think they could have become what they are right now you know with DeMarcus Cousins I think I have better off actually that him and I looked them up as could still be a very very good play when I was going to come back from that injury but I think Dave is probably is better off just because like Nikola Mirotic around him who can spread the floor a little bit now why do that as much but at least Julius Randle can go and get his buckets over so you could Distributors well any solostar on the team that surrounded with the role plays for Anthony Davis letting him basically do whatever he wants out there this level up that Drew holiday it has taken is really what is going to Define if the Pelicans are better with or without Boogie acting up or down on Rudy gobert repeating as defensive player of the year you think he does down defensively in the 56 games that Rudy gobert going to still be the case again this year he is the linchpin of their defense and he's also the face of their defense when you think of the Jazz having a great defensive start with Rudy gobert there were times Chris Paul hit and mid-range after mid-range just because that's what the Jazz game up that's not every team in the league of Kawhi Leonard coming back cuz obviously going to change things a little bit I don't know if he will be the same defensive presents for the Raptors as he was for the Spurs because the Spurs have such an incredible system defensively reach that level but just to see if you can achieve what he did for San Antonio is going to be important for Toronto's defense does come back and then have that same defensive presents that I didn't use going by I think I'll Horford is going to sneak in it a deep hole here before his career is over I think he wasn't really appreciated in Boston's number one offense or number one defense I should say last season this year he will be at 9 cuz you can have to play more five it was Gordon Hayward Kyrie Irving coming back or going to play for out in him at the 5 so people will start to look at him and say all this guy is 696 * blank Center all the time again first best defense I think people will come to specially the defensive player of the year award you have to like it takes a couple years at times to get to the level where people go oh yeah he does deserve Horford is in that there was a little bit of Gainesville mentally ill Marcus all he had that happen can you just needs a close to write about you signing Dwight Howard going to regret it I'm being a Charlotte and he leaves at Lannon we say all that didn't end well and there's the stories actually exactly who wrote a story about his Atlanta Hawks teammates screaming enjoy happiness into their phone when they found out that Dwight Howard left throughout the season throat is season with the Hawks and the Hornets it was all positive and there wasn't any sort of talked about him being a problem in the locker room so I think the wizard situation can't get any worse than last year I think you'll be entirely by great the only reason I'm going up is because that is introductory press conference lights that I learn magic owl and work for a while stung by the Hornets and it all taught me how to be a wizard and when I heard that I was like the wizards they probably already regret this the person is opening line Sullivan lost except for the Wizards Annette strider for him then wife him and then the Wizards came in again that contract Hawaii Marcin Gortat of the head of I can see and that's in a spot if I can finally accept like hey this will try your loss he can still be a very effective play buddy just carries ignore with baggage everywhere he goes in a situation like Washington I'm not sure that's going to work at all that well. And why could you not see a similar scenario don't be demanding a from John Wall or what was that happening in Atlanta and Charlotte the last two years it really wasn't at the end of the season this year vs23 he still getting that money he realizes report the great one are you up or down on the idea of Space Jam 2 LeBron says this is happening space Space Jam Space Jam 2 LeBron I'm assuming we'll start you know bro down with bugs or whatever they finally it's happening so yeah good to have a back I think Kristen ledlow will probably get it check it out you are right if I did I think I would go up even though I don't like Space Jam the original Space Jam who would be the new five monstars more than ever share any question the starters at nba.com by the way if we have these 5 months Stars again we're going to five players playing them and then I was going to be the exact same story but I never blocks are going to do what you got to do we take the pretty questions into the crossfire trade and Lee debate which team is the toughest team to predict back into well cuz the crossfire 3 Rounds determine who is taking home the Bell question number 28 out 50 overall gentleman we know some teams are going to be that we know some things are going to be good which teams has a scratch in your Noggin which is the toughest team to protect the whole season he could be the best player in the East and if he is the Raptors are probably going to be one of the best use of these may be very best team but we haven't seen out of San Antonio yet he's always played in where he was bball dominant guy with the Spurs not to mention this is his first year at the head coach there are few questions to be answered in Toronto before I'm going to stay there the number one seed in the Portland Trail Blazers really strong things in Lafayette then I got to sweat having fun court advantage by the New Orleans Pelicans in the first round I didn't really go out and make any significance to lose in the summer Tyrese on YouTube nuggets and they added Steph Curry by Loft at Davis that table that might be finishing the top four but I may be dropping out of playoffs I say the places you know what I can see you winning this because Kawhi Leonard is amazing alright question number 29 a 50 overall then we follow a 12 months for basketball never stops even in the summer so tell me what was the name of the summer here we go with the Portland Trail Blazers and CJ McCollum had a very very active summer and it was really tough to off when he was criticized the two calling at Kevin Durant joining the Golden State Warriors and CJ up a little bit I hate myself and I want to reply I'm trying Jennifer and of course the internet went to work yeah people started tweeting when the find Jennifer then someone found their fantasy football team name was fantastic and then someone even tried to catch in 9 seconds remaining Ohio take me to make you laugh on the internet nothing made the internet laugh more than the Lakers bench signings Michael Beasley is flying under-the-radar here LeBron try to call the mud but to be on the name don't literally mean that is a very good what is it mean knowing that we've got some creative marketing department throughout the entire NBA but tell me which one is going to go to the edge this season will be the craziest promotional night this season in the NBA ever made an allergy to have a Night at the Roxbury night and it's got to be the Clippers Sobo be until we can show up as Steve and Doug butabi and do the classic are you guys Brothers know at the Roxbury kill in Atlanta I'd like to feel loved by same so I think we're going to have a white shirt with everyone it's ends up being slaves to fly out I think he's going to love that free t-shirt finally finally sucker for lost back on coming up tomorrow is part 4 of the starters NBA season preview series will discuss which team is under the most pressure which NBA sophomore will take that next step no shortage of second-year players to pick from and is this thing the Spurs finally Vista in Space Jam to love it and I talked about how we always have questions about Larry Johnson Charles Barkley Patrick Ewing and Shawn Bradley all right so we know we know lyrics Charles Barkley Draymond Green stash let us know alright thank you for joining us and remember 30 questions down 20 to go race tonight people
