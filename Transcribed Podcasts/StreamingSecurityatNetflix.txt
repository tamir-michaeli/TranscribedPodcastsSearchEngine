we are Netflix podcast for people who love Netflix and want to learn how we do we do is it a rule in the security side of things on Netflix to have people don't speak English as their first language is that like a necessity it's a requirement before we hired and English I've noticed is good for me cuz I'm and I'm doing a half-hearted job that to us teaching myself to learn even the basic cuz just astronomical for me I told that person it's very hard to tell how tall does mutated every time I say it so French I spend a bunch of time in Spain and Mexico it's okay I'm doing the service Michael JavaScript enough to pass high school English as my teacher wrote on all my papers chicken chapter 10 year high school reunions Philip on has a Bachelor of Science and Mathematics and computer science from Ohio State University and a masters computer science with the folks in cryptography from Stanford University graduate 2007 Ford Focus on Fairplay crypto and afters internship Philip worked at Apple as a crypto software engineer developer for 2 years during this time apple and before and from school Phillip co-founded good game a web-based project to process online event registration and credit card payments for student groups and University departments at Stanford Philip left Apple in 2010 to join us here at Netflix and over 8 years and that's how things change Nat years I've grown a lot personally and the career-wise I came in for the green outside Netflix gave me a great opportunity to pursued different interest in different alert about different Technologies and just really grow as a as an engineer so we have an ad in your colleague do you want to lose your calling sure if this if they're trying to take away 42 mm mm mm I had an abortion to come to the Bay Area for one year internship hey i k a break your she will and I met love in California and 7 mm to come back and I've been here since then I went through a bunch of different companies buying it up in 2007 during Apple where I'm at it 2 years into his eyes he was trying to convince me to come join in 7 2012 play Netflix on with that we can talk about at some point I've been here for 6 years I was asleep but then I come back and I came back if we're not feeling the company's needs some point someone made a decision what was that based around 12 and I can say that I was not doing a very good job of that and so after waiting on my manager of the time decided that he needed to make a change right you know it's such a difficult conversation so I don't that can say that was jumping for joy it was definitely a good move it work for you question them you said things I like about it I took a year to go to something else and give me enough to think about what I like to do and what I do like to do and what it is I didn't do well and so I can vacuum can you do a contributor roll and since then so are you not looking in the gym and then you were like I tried that didn't work out for me because by the time I came back the person who had to ask me to leave for us now my posting what's my hot new hiring versus boss middle of sense to me and it's really hard to get into a place where you're not doing excellent your job and are asked to leave and grow from that I'm I'm surprised you thought that it would make a lot of sense and feel good comeback was it a good decision to come back here it was a great decision to come back he wasn't as cold out as you're making it out to be right it was really a question of lust I want to do something else for your it was a thought of people to faint stone at the still year was right time to go do something else and they happen to be a good opportunity that match my skills and my interest well and having to be the place nice work and then we did not matter but it wasn't like the old people that knew the situation yeah back everybody know yes it was then you make a decision on good terms I'm back into doing it to do something that I think I'm going to do well so your previous experience in a relationship you had with the previous people I have impeded your progress your initial progress when it came back it was the interactions that ultimately had to have with my successor the guy who took over the position I have a great no way that goes come tell people what they need to do right now so I'm going to have to guess we'll be around that time so I'm sure that I was single jokingly because it's been an ongoing debate within the team we don't want to be the enforcer now then it's not a good experience to do it and if you understand the rationale you don't need to be told to do it I think you're pointed it really depends on the situation and I think for us to be successful we have to assess each situation kind of individually usually our our our normal stance Rd for status of consultant by the way here to help you and we come in with an open mind of trying to learn what is it sticks the interest what were the business goals what are they trying to do and then provide guidance provide some boundaries for them to achieve those goals there's a lot of security groups at Flex fan from I know there's teams that help me and I'll make sure that I've got two part of education on my system you guys don't do that there's a lot of space there so can you look at your group actually focus is on right now streaming security that's our files stay private but also shared to everyone or Planet if she hurts and I did very very high divorce yet making sure of that I think the way that we can defend ourselves as distinguished from all other security orc is a focuses primarily on the devices on the client side right where most of the security company in the rest of the world to most of the security teams would be application security the fullback in applications would be network security of the it security we are focusing on unconscious we work closely with our partners to make sure that their devices are robust enough against you no tempering of some some kinds weight of the team evolve in in the history of of how things do flocked we happen to also own the security protocol that we use for some of the communication between a client in the server names of those calls you know where the cookie guys who said well TLS is not good enough for us so we can even our own thing it sounds not that great when you put it that way we think that we had a really good reason that we eat that this was not meaning of me or needs and I we need to do our own thing okay let me just clarify what that that's kind of shocking to hear but TLS is the back of her go to a website to secure a CPS are you to the lock in the icon all that the protocol that does that the handshake and it does that is called tlso used to be called as hell but it's actually TLS now cuz you're saying the entire internet uses this protocol write something better for us is never even going to hunt you down for a call when you can you get something established so why you why we do that while we go to missile and not Duty left a little benefit pros and cons here she has enough to meet Rick communication wire out of his clients your web browser some random joke right at home and you connect to somebody Walnut there's any chemistry there were as a client I want to know who I'm going to but one thing to the Zuri care about who I am right and then that the connection is secure and this whole system relies on this fairly heavy duty and checking around around the determination of Who You connecting to a piece of it always so difficult that are signed make sure that I wasn't aware you already got hold of 790 K I think that's very heavy duty very high requirements and it is a symmetric were interested for conviction to this will help you out inside you to clients you though the user and a typhoon you could have came to the not the other way around I'd Netflix we on both hands me on the back on the Netflix app that runs on the client's right and we care to enforce that only Netflix clients connect to a Vicodin use and if it serviced by Netflix clients do you mean Netflix approved devices or logged in users Netflix Apple devices so we need to identify two clients and TLS doesn't help then if we need to just wait and let me talk line Security on certificates and that comes with heavy Apartments about time management thought thought out and show you that you have some Phil get some experience here trying to do it all the Alaska's missiles are relatively Newport Apartments been around it started since I got here about 4 years ago or so before we had missile we had the interview date there's a high desire for flexibility is in TV add-on protocols well Netflix ticket based authentication desire high-level flexibility or on many many thousands of skews of devices and it's Paramount for us to be able to go to graphically identify nothing to keep each device because that tells us something about the platform security that device that tells us something about the level of security provided by the device which tells us something about what type of what type of content we should authorize for the device it gives us High assurance that as an example the Netflix application is less likely to be used as an attack Vector to Target specific users mean we're putting some software on people's TVs or exactly declares and technically the larger surface are there more complicated application is the more risk we put their device at other attacks that's exactly right so when you be careful about that it's their ownership role okay so as we decrease the stack stack better for using it to something like a part of all of our cells were not relying on something like open as a salvage how could ever have a bug in it away if it doesn't so what causes to have a safe environment for customers that's that's completely right and on several devices we don't control that felt in a Cell stack actually the whole HTTP https going to sell stock is provided by where to buy Spider-Man has to be so I'm sure that was a painful experience I do want to ask you when we decide to say you know and we had this for a call and we learn from that and we need to learn from the Kerberos flow an hour to fix this new thing called missile we had developed a whole new way of ensuring all these things you're talking about and replacing the technologies that are heavily proven over time you have to invest a lot of suffering time to make that work it was so interesting since you've been on the podcast with us talk about it we have three of our colleagues are deeply invested in this how many hours in the needs of the challenges TLS four other people for you guys is great because there's a ton of tools if you need to you can always go do what you need because all the tuning is there because the rest of the world uses it for me some women suffering a little bit about that because if there's going to be tuning we need to do the 22nd so right now I'm on the iOS platform in a Michaels on TV and website platforms and so we're developing all the time we're getting a lot of data of course we do but we also have images and a data like the title in hand synopsis is of all the episodes and all the images for the episodes the whole user interface and all of that stuff also is going through to you last night and it's doing that because we're doing more standard system for using tom cat on earth layer Java layer that's the web server is running and we're course running in apples to buy some reasons to be sad from there and so to get really secure data TLS makes a lot of sense and we use this great little call Charles which is a proxy the allows me to put inserts in the box and my device and I can inspect that create a man-in-the-middle attack myself to help me develop the applications very useful tool Charles is a great song but that won't work at mistletoe are you saying he still developing is doing streaming stuff can't use a tool out of the box like that from some of the company you got to generate your own right exactly right so we do have a proxy a minute injected pork say to dump out me so long to come up with it as much as Charles. It is a great tool it's very easy to use I don't know that we had the same level of different know how many servings in the team to make the coolest quite as nice to use Rite Aid has lost because I never use the ladies that the Crux of the problem it's it is somewhat of a tough sail across the company because it also comes with higher bar in terms of usability right so it is up to us to rise to the challenge to speak and and and make sure that as we care to get me some other did Wiley with a Netflix we need to give ourselves that means to to do so right now picking up someone to build tools to make this easier more depth ability trying to pick someone up to join the Army Seal Team know who is responsible to you would be to the watch now that's funny but it seemed a little would be responsible to get to Jewel so do the tuning for a long time we moved away from our own like physical Hardware server rooms were in AWS we do a physical Hardware that we have is open connect boxes they're all over the place on the planet and that's our own Hardware that has our catalog in this allows us to make really great relationships with smaller Eyes Peas where they don't have to use out but bandwidth they can use been with from inside their eyes P to their customer base using one of our boxes and we manage those boxes and we truly Park images and other static assets we put it on a large LCD and like Akamai some public company that does that kind of work or even on a divorce is service of that layer we've been moving slowly to our own boxes to do some of those assets because in some regions it's really beneficial for the customer we can actually get better traffic through put from our box at local you know somewhere in Indy or something when we do that as we move the entire Hardware stack and everything in there are you saying that potentially we could move to all assets being delivered through missile instead of TLS because we control besides a conversation I would categorize the effort to gain that performance for missile higher because the effort to optimize of CPS has already been done so now you are asking other teams like what we have this thing that works and works fairly and optimize way hey come into this other new thing and by the way you have all this effort they need to put up to get the same optimization I never heard the idea of moving other resources besides the streaming feed to mess also that was why I was curious about it in a while and hadn't heard that idea there are many reasons internal and external as to why you also makes a lot of sense to keep assets and I said delivery or receipt if she is dealing with a partner I'm assuming that at this point there's a lot of desire to have Netflix on devices and such right so first started release date for the company that is at least starts his ate his good business process for us right so what time you guys are talking to Engineers those teams they're kind of on board in solving the problem so I'm assuming that you engage with people at these large corporations that are Engineers like yourself doing this what is it like to do that how what's a relationship like it's great it's super interesting because we get to Foster this relationship with our colleagues at the other companies become a Samsung LG Sony an LDS OC Fender's real take me to take dropping blood and we're Security Consultants for these four for these Collingwood where we're trying to help that we're trying to help them with the design how do you design a robust Platinum security where the Netflix application can run in a manner where the user doesn't have to worry about being targeted with with viruses worms if they don't have to worry about the Netflix application being an attack Vector for someone to display pictures of you why to extract account login information for TV feel safer than your web browser say that we have a small part in making generating that feeling from from Yahoo music when you're working with a team you're not just talking about like you have to do these things for us to talk about money problems they might have with what they are implementing and how to potentially Hartnett that's right under the time constraints life is everybody wants to ship a device to ship a product and also this is caused which may be at times in direct conflict with security goals trade-off between security risk and business reward becomes interesting equation one thing I'm very curious about what security do to how it impacts our customers how does freedom and responsibility look like on a security team place of Freedom no responsibility responsibility and more responsibility because a problem has many Touch of Solutions in each solution reduces risk in different ways to different levels security risk so that there's a lot of freedom for us to do to reach out to our counterparts at these big companies and engage in it and they have Frank conversation about yours or your devices today is the risks that we see with what you're doing right now where to send your business goals we understand how business goes we also understand that we need to ship this but yesterday what can we do what can we do in in the short-term in the midterm and then what's our strategic bats to make sure that is a risk that we have identified gets reduced to get reduced to a level where everybody feels comfortable when you are assessing a tryst you guys mostly do this you could do talk a lot about yourself responsibilities and stuff if you if you were talking to your son like that how do you assess best practices in and make sure that all of your kind of an alignment with I feel like that's the the strength of the team because we do talk with each other none of us know everything is just impossible but we leverage each other's knowledge and experience to get to a really fought the best date we can so there's a lot of talk there's a lot of lot of conversations at times heated we have we're taking the problem we're we're we're all focus on attacking the problem honey you know that sounds like so much of your job is not out of keyboard typing away code it sounds like a lot of relationship yes and no so yes partner facing job is one of our hearts and you can tell fitty where is that has quite a bit and was very well we have some time the cue ball to I'm more of that kind of fun of an engineer and one of the reasons for that is wild most of our clients or Indian done types of parties by the sum of a plan squishy pop sales mobile apps app as well the game console version of that takes we develop in the house and she also the browser version of the prayer we do ourselves on his knee so for those platforms on a technical level the rubber hits the road and we have to actually provide any love I need to go 880 M solution and we have to be in the way that he is no again we're blessed enough that meets a bar that we find Community Gribble but within the constraints of not always being able to rely on the on the system itself and to do it for us and can you talk about the roles that you guys do have open and kind of what you're looking for Can You Feel It can you well I don't know what the property managers play house right now if it was we lost our directors we need to replace that we need somebody to take on that role and you know run the team for Ultra manager positions open one for our team for the entry team won for the talking about the missile injuring team it's going to split it off and we need somebody to run that right we have people in the tech World light organizers projects from the the public facing aspect of it and like benefiting Society in the world in general and have a company like Netflix back in the development of its kind of a neat space to being so that's a pretty compelling space to most of the focus of the team though is he on the integration of missile within the Network signal system itself so that touches last meet me on the on the I'm supposed to be part of it which is really the cord I can look at it the basic system but no one comes to integrating this is where most of the work has to be done and then we have at least one open position on the missile team we know that and want it all team as well I think one of our team and one of them in all the big names as far as SOC manufacturing and with all of the cable providers across the world in Opie's animal talk to them about security please confirm job. Netflix.com I think it's not just about having a direct positive influence into the devices that get built and shipped I used to but now it's two young kids at home well thank you but was everything else you guys want to talk about regarding what you're doing and is it wise to Tristan before we wrap it up why do we exist in the first place fine because it is clean. Gears of business because the core of what we do at Netflix in general is we we distribute somebody else is content but we started doing something else is called when somebody else trust us with their content they come in with their own requirements and we need to make sure that you're not going to lose track of this because otherwise it and we are committing in business terms to those content owners then we turn around and work with the house beside the device manufacturers and we have to have the same conversation of hey we're on the hook for the other ones were wearing this will happen to you when to work on Monday Gribble terms where you going to be able to help us and of course all aspects aspects of it and help the whole picture together it's going to make sure that we can all that that that we have Technical Solutions that are available and suitable and and appropriate for for the part of my hands but to me for long as I've been working on on on some protection Solutions what would have liked is that aspect of being at that intersection between technology and in business that's that's something that's what you're saying that the public sees that the name of the technical part of it and the street in front of it but you also want to think about the RMS being that the small price to pay for all this content to be available in the first place it makes a business sleeping with Wellbutrin described and I would like to add one more that mention and that is the user experience when we think about security-related stuff one of the function requirements that's very dear to us is an impact the user experience can we take it as a mandatory Flex a requirement to preserve a good ux2 neighborhood at user experience if if instead we we develop a design something that leads to bad user experience we're not done our job a lot of conversations internally and externally starts with that were the first bullet point being how does this impact user experience it's a good it's a good way to line people's goals right oh yeah and it just makes a lot of sense because we're the business delighting lots and lots of users miss you failed to do that then well we were not we disagree team not contributing to the company's goals are you guys watching right now I just started a series called dark so I did okay well I'll let you fill out your phone if you want it said it's two guys in wet Hot south east of of the us having conversations Adventures Michael very little television for the kids but adults Lana night we do Westworld which is an HBO show current oh my god really what were very very excited for us that 3% coming up so we're kind of Countdown the day it was so good how cold it is our first Brazilian and I do not do dubs you read it all doesn't bother me I want to know if I guess whatever that group of people is called the people who would rather have a dump and some people would rather have a tongue twister Bradley and eating well but Dark shows the casino I'll be enjoying God shows right now is anything light and fun that's been in cars when is really fun for me I like to hear Santa Clarita diet I'm learning quite a few things for myself right now. That just hit me up once in awhile I go back to the office and watch select always find A to Z episodes because he just they're just able to capture uncomfortability people feel uncomfortable about Michael Scott it's just so painful and some episode like crying on the floor and a company made it just like I'm assuming that's very different office space for rent in with what we feel here and Netflix but what's the what's the best thing about working here or there's this many things but I would say my colleagues I'm I'm always pleasantly surprised I'm always in our for our talented and hard-working there and it it really is great when you have a colleague that says yes I'll do that and then it magically gets done it's nice for life it's amazing thank you both
