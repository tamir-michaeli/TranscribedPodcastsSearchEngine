Episode 1  Blockchain  A Brief Story Of Trust
welcome to the first episode of block and roll with beer and Karen wow that's a great intro Karen and thank you for giving us the kick-off I just like to welcome everybody to the podcast wherever you were listening to this on a plane train automobile or on the city of this running about I hope you enjoy listening to this as much as we enjoyed making it I just like to clear up one point this podcast is pure really focused on blockchain and anything to do with that we will not be talking about fans will not be talking about like it splits the latest hits or who's getting back together again so I hope you enjoy it and strap yourself in for a rock and roll half an hour talking about blockchain my voice is so terrible that I need the cat scream and throw themselves out building beside my family day thanks for clearing it upso in this mess I'm sorry if you're going to talk about blockchain and briefly about decentralization we will probably try to explain you or simplify the definitions of space station and it's really important it's one of the hottest things around I can give you this example the fact that my mom asked me about Bitcoin going to die says about how much - how important is Delta case I know you asked me the other day she asked me what his money after the importance of money but I know man the Lord she's around as me trusting and obviously maybe from your point of view as well I'm being told that I have a micro agressive shop to me I didn't realize I was doing some training and explain to me that what I said that my desk and I'm working away that could be interpreted microaggression you have to see me when I can go as woke up walking around the place probably just stay away from me let's roll let's begin by trying to explain and can you explain to me without using any other job in times like cryptography distributed Ledger or any of those types of things that you hate generally found it about but pain is yes I'll try it's a peer-to-peer technology it enables transactions between any two people with the computer or some fun so the day we sent each other is not stolen one central place or is not controlled by one company it's computers this new one into the organisation controlling this network and this is this is a real change this is what's making everybody excited because the way that this is over holding the current system but I guess I guess people want you wondering how how how are these computers how these people connected yes definitely tonight so it works through the channels that are already created on top of Internet that's why you can you can you hear people saying is the next generation of consent or web 4.0 and some fancy X summarize what we being Pokey by pretty little thing about this move away from The Trusted that party which is which is something that's always be necessary by City before so if I want to be able to transfer money to you than knowing that I have to go to a bank and the bank is trusted to take money from my account and put into your account or if we want to do something in terms of if it's buying a house or something house it would be a trusted by the government that would be up to transfer the deed between the right of the parties yes so if you want to feel buying the line you go to an estate agent and then you'll be referred to as soon as it's white and you put a bank in world so and you go to register so you've got all these organisations what percentage of your info when you get to list is involved when you get all these different policies that have to agree that it's not standard process it seems very expensive as well your house is so expensive that's a perfect analogy for like things that might be good analogy for in times of need to be the having puffing information so I was given example of the drawing straws from from my perspective that sounds like a Fair Oaks on. Evil name of the played this game before but you got some straws and you make one shorter than the other pics the shortest straw it's person that has to do the deed so this this means that there's no need for a central Authority in this game because it means everybody has put up against mation cuz everybody can see who won who lost you had a really good example I thought and I'm not sure if I'm an Indian wedding example is that was I thought was really good then it's telling me that in India and one of the reasons that everybody comes to your wedding is because then the groom can never deny that actually happened to Carmelo for the diary so yeah me that's that's that's about that some examples why I can think of what it's going to be like no need for a central party to be up to arbitrate between the axis and funny blockchain hike around it sounds very complex would you say sold in a complex problem I don't think it's actually is holding a complex form the technology behind it over Generations we relied on Central authorities by governments right or corporations to provide session do you know transactions and if there was a problem you can go to a code to write you can go to financial Ombudsman so they used to take care of these problems but now the pack is going to replace them so we can rely on technology so I can have sex with you while you're just relying on technology decentralization I think this is one of those steps yeah I mean I guess just to say to your first point that I mean the idea of of people trading without their parties isn't necessary new in that if if if people eat alone. So things transacted before they have to do it but it's being basically because you trusted each other so we could exchange goods together I could sell you something and you could buy it without the Beatles anybody that to validate say I mean obviously you never buy from me because you don't trust me but that's beside the point the point is that people have enough to do this but it's it's now moving to stay where we are leaving me who don't know each other that I trust each other but I still able to trade without us a party exactly so example for example of God eBay you've got Amazon you've got so many online centralized big comfy that'll actually acting on your behalf to buy goods and services on eBay you your I should trust in eBay you know that you're part of green bees is being sold to you you know that's what I figured that's why you be acting like a mini man with this technology in the future you can rely the person that's transaction on the other side if you want you can you know you can trust and say all this the phones we provide you the trust because I'm using eBay what are these they want you to do something like PayPal which is equivalent of that thing that Saturday so this year that you got the money and the I've received the money excetra excetra that's that's what they were teasing me though that it's just the way of the same Principle as we have a virus before it just may be meeting me somewhere to eat or I experienced this is going to change because you're not have to have that the bank will weather is today yes so you don't have those Central organizations but you still have technology so so so using this technology would leveraging off the power the blockchain gives us to do you say what do the same thing for you to do but a new way basically can you explain how this works I think one of the one of the key Mysteries all confusion that comes about with how this is actually happening in in terms of the mechanics of a bunch of transactions that happen and they phone was cool to block blocks together and using was cooled a digital signature this enables security because because it's Unique this digital signature it means that if anything would change to any point in any of the blocks one of the transactions then it would be the same signature so it would be rejected by the rest of the community did you give you a different kind of example of a book with page numbers each page has a list of transactions and every page has a number in sequence people allow you to identify the previous and next page when you're on a particular page so I paid you like a block in the whole book that is blockchain network is a really good example of the fact that we can acquire a the transactions happen in the on the block with the transaction on the page and then 30 pages make up what is cool. So if you want to Google Docs eyeshadow page with you on Google Docs new update your your document basically with the new transaction yes Sophia I have one more question for you how do you think the history behind it the first emerged but the first digital cash with radiant 2009 and that was the currency for Bitcoin which I think everybody's heard of because of the massive rise in value of a coin and then I'm sure you would have people haven't heard of Illuminating how important is this weekend I said we're going to Ricardo first podcast what is it about so I said that's what she said but the and technology behind Bitcoin is what fraction is variation producer with the first application for blockchain blockchain gave us the ability to remove the need for the central government and has been one of the key changes and where the key drive it as well because at the time off to the financial crisis in 2008 there was a lack of trust in the financial system people felt that the issuing authority is behind the currencies of the dollar I'm what effectively gaming the system so that they and able to thanks to win and Bitcoin was a way of stopping the control by central banks and then remove that controls got the issue money and undermine that I might see if actively yes so from what I heard they is a person called Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 after the financial crisis remove the central government's these organizations that are managing the economy that I'm managing the cash so he's going to come up with a decent one and that's how he came up with Bitcoin eventually the technology behind it actually. This is a great idea we can actually explain this idea father and basically it's it's it's it's it's a single person in the world but it's a group of people but whoever is he he was Anonymous to put that. Disappear Completely and sensation so what are the implications do we think. Menson traditional institutions with the Advent of blockchain I think they will be there but I don't think they will go completely out of existence so you can continue adding more on that so it's a whole different possibilities of where you could use blockchain but there are some things in which actually using blockchain would be more expensive because of the fact akhiran talked about earlier that there's a copy everyone holds a copy of it it means that there is more that small processing is more expensive in in in in some applications so it would make sense in some applications to have a hybrid between a centralized and the distribution model and where they make it possible to do that do you know how do I know how things were going to discuss I think in the future for coughs so I mean we can talk about this is really pushing her away from the center about desensitization is it to talk about it more yes he's a very very interesting topic to me through social media if you take Facebook if you're able to communicate with the rest of the world take a difference between YouTube Twitter face but they taken what was previously a reed coaches so when I say that what I mean is that used to be the case that people use to get paper and then read the news everyday and that information would be written by John list and basically the other the agenda will be set by editors in a newspaper house somewhere in your London property if it was okay or wherever was around the world different than Capital but now we're talking about the people are watching the news people able to rise and communicate with their own audience whatever they want if you're not supposed to be talking about your posts I post for your friends example Donald Trump can jump on to fix her frequently you don't he hates the institution but he said he's there is a power in people's hands to communicate to say one of the thing to create and use and I guess blockchain is the next logical step if you think about it so we had this thing of these Central platforms allowing people to write whatever whatever they want and communicate with each other and now blockchain potentially is pushing the power even though it means that rather than needing Central Central motor always had before we can distribute the power to people even further yeah so does transparency untrust eventually again trusting the technology as for my point is how I see it you have to be able to trust the technology cuz at the end of the day on the line this is from what if you the basics which is that's that's that's the cryptography was cool to cryptography which we talked about that's the the fight of the developers or developing code in developing is this technology in the way that's fair at all so that the community that you interact with is down to how we design and Technology as well so as long as those things are true then you can basically see me you can trust the technology yeah we don't need to trust each other but we trust as a whole yeah so how would we summarize for all this is what we talked about today yes so just to summarize we wouldn't be so kind of games so blockchain is a technology that wax between two people using the internet between them without a central Authority on factions of recording buy used computer network it makes no sense when you hear it takes away with a lot of the same as the Jog and the complexity nothing to help people have to understand more about this topic of this stuff is still evolving and the how this works no one completely it's and it's in a very experimental State at the moment although there are a few applications and verification that I'm being deployed so just what time the space as we progress as we come up with more information more data more knowledge on this topic so thank you for listening and in our next episode will be talking about cryptocurrencies Bistro money if you want to put it like that and the whole idea behind blockchain come from paint finish that we talked about today how do we solve the problem of money have a nice time thank you for cheerleading
