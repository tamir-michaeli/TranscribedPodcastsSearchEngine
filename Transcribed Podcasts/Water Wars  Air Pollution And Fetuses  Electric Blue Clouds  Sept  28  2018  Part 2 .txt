Water Wars  Air Pollution And Fetuses  Electric Blue Clouds  Sept  28  2018  Part 2 
customer support WNYC Studios it's a science Friday I'm Ira Flatow coming up we're going to talk about how Pakistan's Indus River is starting to dry up and why that could catapult the region into war first in pregnancy the placenta as you know is a very critical organ that allows the fetus to obtain nutrition in oxygen and in the process filters harmful substances from the mother's body but our understanding of how protective that placenta is has been changing some ingested substances are known to cross the boundary and cause harm but how about alcohol or foul lights and other kinds of air pollution a mother's exposure is increasingly correlated with health problems in the infant from cardiovascular to neurodevelopment but how do inhaled particles lead to these problems new research in the Journal of the American Medical Association Network open this month is pointing to one mechanism changes in the thyroid what's going on what can be done to protect the most vulnerable from potentially lifelong out the fax my next guest is an author on the research that could carry Breton associate professor of preventive medicine at the USC in Los Angeles walking back to Brandon Ocean and the thyroid well believe it or not I grew up in Southern California in the 80s and I was I grew up living through smoggy alert days and swimming in the summer and feeling that really icky feeling in your lungs after a bad air day and so I've been thinking about air pollution for many years now and really want to understand how early in life do these does air pollution affect us and so we wanted to look in the womb and ask a question at the earliest stage of Life can air pollution affect our health and we started with looking at the thyroid because the thyroid is very important in metabolism and Fetal brain development in infants whose mothers were exposed to more air pollution how could that affect a child's health later in life well we know that steroid hormones are really important as I said in the kabbalism and in brain growth and we already know that having either too little hormone or too much homework can have that affects that's in fact why the state of California in other states have a newborn screening program that test newborns for thyroid home alone because if the baby has two little hormone they can intervene they can give medications and they can prevent the cognitive deficits from happening so there's a lot that's already known about thyroid hormone hormone levels and how they affect health and so if the environment now is affecting those levels it may be skipping our systems making us more vulnerable for these health effects to be clear you so hormonal changes but this isn't proof of direct harm yet there are harms write tell us why well in this study all we measured was the thyroid hormone T4 directly and we measured it in the newborn so what we showed was at higher particulate matter is associated with higher thyroid hormone levels but we did not in this study relate that change and thyroid hormone levels to any child health I'll come later in life that's actually something we would like to see what the next step doesn't seem to matter what kind of air pollution were talking about like particulates or chemicals or small particle set whatever yes it does matter we looked at both of particulate matter as well as ozone and I can take nitrogen dioxide so several different ambient pollutants that are very typically a regulated and monitored Across the Nation and in Los Angeles and we saw these effects of particulate pollution not with ozone or not nitrogen dioxide of the mechanism you know there are a lot of serious and there are a lot of Investigations into this one of those is that air pollution in general maybe increasing inflammation throughout the body and that's that may have its own set of cascading effects as the baby is developing seeing more and more wildfires now that might be wild fires emit a lot of particulate matter they may be different sizes of particulate matter in different composition than vehicle exhaust in diesel exhaust but it's still fundamentally particulates come from incomplete combustion and things that burn and wildfires burn a lot of stuff and they have we had tons of particles into the air are understanding of air pollution in health changing from what it used to be well I think what I can safely say is that we know air pollution is bad for us and we're finding you know that even at the earliest moments in life it may be bad for us but I can't tell you was at in Southern California we've been trying to reduce air pollution for decades now and we've. We've been successful in doing that the levels have come down in the last decade in part because we've regulated emissions and you know the nice thing about this is that we've also seen the corresponding increases in kids health when air pollution levels to come down so we know it works and we know we can do something about it you really have enough to know that Dan and then a few years to know that it does it doesn't matter that we have empty stuff in our own work we followed a cohort of children called the children's health study for more than 20 years and the whole purpose of that a study was to look at air pollution's effects on kids house do we know if particles are actually crossing the placental or is there some intervening mechanism certainty and I think it's going to be very dependent on what size particle were talking about in the weather the placenta can filter that out and be that barrier or also weather in the mom the particles cause an indirect effect and then all those Cascade and chemicals and molecules that changed the mom can pass the placenta even if the particle itself doesn't know I don't have to tell you you've already told me that you've grown up in Southern California or its smoggy and polluted and it still polluted water places now I'm and in those days we always have and always on alert right before that we tell we tell the elderly not to go out or to breathe easier to stay indoors should we be saying that to pregnant mothers now be careful and you chat you can text daily the air quality index and you and if you see that it's a really bad air day you might want to change your behavior you might want to not go out and exercise really heavily you might want to walk your dog on a quieter Street away from heavy traffic. So there are little things that you that you could do These Warnings why not including these relations you know then then yes you do know I mean might want to consider it I think it's a sort of an individual level decision give you the $64 question I give to a lot of my research is if you had an unlimited blank check in I have one right here in my pocket for you what would what would you like to study what would you need to know how would you do that well I would continue to address the broader question can the environment what and how can the environment affect fetal development and and what is that tie to 10 years 20 years down the line as we become adults are we now going to be at increased risk and more susceptible for all of these things that we're dealing with and we could start with the thyroid and there's a lot more we could do with understanding the thyroid itself looking at it more holistically looking at the difference between how it affects mom thyroid and babies thyroid together and disentangling that but there are also other pollutants one could ask the same questions about drugs or thing like that or plastic to know more we are I really addressed outdoor air pollution and in this particular publication indoor air pollutants in the forces of those of the whole other ball game is there any phase of pregnancy you know I'm I'm assuming that the earlier in pregnancy pregnancy first trimester is more important than others or am I being wrong about that will actually went weed we have to try to dress at Crescent the Civic Lee in the publication and we looked at month-by-month exposures in pregnancy to see if we could find that what one month matter the most in terms of being exposed and what we really found was that actually most of pregnancy matter added that exposure anywhere from mid to late pregnancy not quite as much in the early very early pregnancy and that might have something to do with the fact that the thyroid the field sorry does doesn't actually develop and start kicking in and producing its own thyroid until the second trimester thought that you would that you might give pregnant moms thyroid do you know pills or injections or anything like that to him to measure the level in the fetus and say well we need to have some more or less what I think there's a lot of monitoring of that already and so if I'm if a pregnant woman's thyroid levels fall within what are clinically normal ranges you wouldn't need to do anything anyway but that's an interesting thought someone who have a thyroid disease going into pregnancy they are already monitor for that and yes they could they will be monitored in a tenant they try to adjust those levels is getting any better I mean better meaning less up here California guest we've had reductions in our air pollution levels but in many other places around the world they are pollutants going up actors know about air pollution as a potential hazard environmental harm such as air pollution when you're in the doctor's office today dr. Britton at the USC in Los Angeles good luck to you thank you for being so informative with us today or you want the wars of the future may be fought the over water and it says it's going to be a really big issue water rides at Jeff Nesbitt is author of a new book this is the way the world ends how drought and die offs heat waves and hurricanes are converging on America he's going to be here with us I never 844-724-3255 I can also sweetest at SCI Fri will be right back after this break stay with us play Science Friday on Myra Play-Doh 4 years ago Saudi Arabia as big as dairy company call Delmar a started buying up land in the Arizona desert why would they do that so he Arabia was running out of water and the company needed Alfalfa highly water intensive crop to feed their cows and the area where they Farm has less restricted access to the Colorado River and the states water less restricted them places like Phoenix or Tucson meaning it's a great place to make hay and then ship it overseas back to Saudi Arabia is this just a little foreshadowing about the future of water and about how big a commodity H2O will be coming a hotter dryer world at some places already looking at Solutions like turning waste water into drinking water and here's a question for our listeners does your city already recycle waste water and put back in your TAP how does it taste was there an egg factor and was it a political fight to get it done our number +84-472-482-5584 Forsyth I can also tweeted stats I fry reason I'm bringing all of this up is because my next guest right about the future of water of Water and other climate-related conflicts in his new book this is the way the world ends how drought and die of heat waves and hurricanes are converging on America Jeff Nesbitt is the author executive director of climate Nexus a nonprofit that focuses on climate change Communications hazy former director of public relations at the National Science Foundation way back in the day to see you other countries coming here to use u.s. water resources that right about Saudi Arabia it is absolutely right and then some of the folks in Arizona didn't take so kindly to her there was a very contentious Town Hall not too long ago were they at for sheriff's deputies planted outside the the hall as they were trying to explain the store in Saudi Arabia goes back even further Saudi Arabia made up up ridiculously bad bat where they began to drain the water aquifer to try to grow wheat they paid folks to that paid Farmers to grow weed and they essentially drain the water aquifer that has some of their freshwater that have been in place for thousands of years so then you combine that with climate change sitting on top like the 800-pound gorilla they essentially run out of water so they've had to go elsewhere to get crops that are water intensive so they can feed their people and that's like and Arizona cable said Wikileaks is released China's doing the same thing they bought up that you know the America's largest pork producer in order to do the same thing sell both Saudi Arabia and China going around the world 2 to try to solve their natural resource problems going to see more and more of this has water becomes more scares everyone the point of this book is it water is more scarce in lots of places on Earth would like in the United States we live in a temperate zone I'm we're lucky that some of the worst impacts of climate change aren't here yet they're definitely hear another Parts the world sub-Saharan Africa some countries simply don't have any food at all why Northern Africa is is suffering in the Sahel region you say quote Yemen is the first casualty of what will almost certainly be the water wars of the future Yemen is a fascinating story people have already written about what happened in Syria when the farmers moved out of their off their Farms to the cities and it triggered the civil unrest they look at Egypt where the food riots led to the Arvest Bank Yemen is a big is a more Stark example diplomats knew that country was one of them running out of water they rent 14 to 16 aquifers or Drano water and they were predicting to the water Minister and I going to have riots in the streets and you need to to deal with this they didn't and that's exactly what two years later civil unrest in the claps the government so that's what a water War looks like the future is here now and meaning disruption it is absolutely in this is this is one of the reasons why National Security analyst have looked at climate change as an imminent national security threat or silver water give rewards of a food insecurity and I'll tell your half the people in the world right now are eating food that's imported into the country because there isn't enough land arable and others to grow it right now so it's here now in other parts of the world that's what I hear you saying the title of your book this is the way the world ends that comes from not with a bang but with a whimper so it's a little drip drip drip under the radar until it's until it's no longer until it's you know then then people fight or M&D a good example that I did sort of went on noticed is India and Pakistan almost went to war overwater less than a year ago in Kashmir Erwin India threaten to shut off access to the Indus River and threatened to start a war that if any should make that decision Pakistan would suffer Downstream of China then make a similar decision it would harm both India and Pakistan so these drip drip drip of water as they run out of water can can delete it to catastrophes essentially talking about the future pool water features like his equatorial futures or commodity Futures not only are we we all I can tell you with certainty I just met with the enemy of I met with the billionaire who was already planning to treat water as a commodity or heat they will sell water to places like northern China and Saudi Arabian others it is at where absolutely they're already in some parts of the world. Hornick a cartel of water bottle of water just yet but what people are looking at this is a business talking with Jeff the Jeff Nesbitt author of this is the way the world ends about droughts and die out so he waves and hurricanes are converging on America let's get a phone call or two and let's go to I-10 in Tucson I can are we still using Aquaphor they trying to back in the nineties and it destroyed the water system and they recycle water is heated is used for golf course thanks for the call so I wouldn't that's very interesting to hear they they Tucson and others might want to go talk to Mara Garcetti Los Angeles because they actually are they have figured this out how to reclaim water a significant portion of Los Angeles as water is starting to come from reclaimed water have a plan to have it it's a pretty extensive plan for doing that I think I'm honestly other cities need to start taking this out my when time was at the American Water Works Association speaking the air while back and I went to the exhibit area and they are people there who called me so you know we are recycling water we are we are we now can you know Supply cities on larger and larger scale were experimenting with it and I said to him kind of people tell the difference you said they certainly can when they drink are recycled water they notice as much tastier I mean it's good news about also talk to their water district leadership they think about climate change every single day in Los Angeles right now they're planning for that right now and they have plans I think a third eye I don't remember the exact number but it's very significant portion the water's going to come from reclaimed water you tell a really interesting story and I lead into this by saying you know don't people listen to scientists anymore you should be concerned about this trip trip trip is but you really gone cover the Greek mythology about Albert Einstein and if Dr tell us that story you tell him the book Dead said there's this Mithun now you probably know the truth I'm sure but they're there this myth that Albert Einstein writes a letter the famous Albert Einstein writes letter to FDR warns that the Nazis are about to in that scientists are about to unlock the atom and developing a nuclear bomb and that that triggered the process that letter after the third letter after the second letter I think first or second letter they fought them off on lieutenant in a little Commission in through $60,000 and I'm reconfirming it built know what you did to try to test the theory because basically at the Art of War II Prosperity didn't want to listen to Albert Einstein or the scientist at all it was only when Britain got serious it looking at it did your pants at all maybe we better pay attention to this but so are they did that you're saying that's the power alone we have today it is so there are thousands of of Albert Einstein Klein assigned as yelling as loud as they possibly can please pay attention the wolf is at the door right now if we can't wait for 30 40 50 years to see how this all plays out 844-724-8255 is her number of the you also point out in your book that the large internet companies like Nestle and Coca-Cola and Pepsi or understanding this problem correct the Nestle chapter in this book is fast any people are Nestle has analyzed the water scarcity issue is an every single food company in the world in the world really seriously in Waterford for food that they make Dave analyze water scarcity problems in every country north and they've told diplomats, quietly that it just may be the biggest rock in the world water scarcity issues and lots and lots of countries are there places where they need all this water will call and see if I can get a phone call in from Brandon and I want to go to Georgia Augusta Georgia hi Brandon hello hi there how water recycling wooden base and you're already drinking recycled water fact that they're drawing their Waters from rivers in a cup of water here I take for granted that it's clean and New York City once again they have a severe pollution problem in the river this it's potentially and some places too polluted to cost of the clean up the pollution but here in United States that your colors exactly right they know much of our clean water comes from Rivers where they have to clean you know they have to clean the chemicals to make sure that it didn't come so it's clean but there's a difference between normal process and actually reclaiming water as it runs off who says we wouldn't have to recycle so much water if we stop raising animals for food animal agriculture the problem needs stop encouraging it so there's absolutely some scientific end and then well I'll just say 5 yes there is some truth are the using using land for for you know to basically produce meat meat as a diet takes up a lot of land and we could we could make some progress with natural solutions in the land like growing more trees grow more plants and some of those places it would make it it would make me back it's about 15% of the water problem on a complicated question but he but there's there's he's Crock-Pot that suck about the climate climate change the shipping giant Morris just send a big container ship through the Arctic for the first time in aside from oil exploration that's been going on there the Arctic is the world's next big economic zone right it's free of ice in the summer but it's in the book as well Rush is clearly paying attention to his they have six seven eight dice Cutters they're preparing to deal with it you know an Arctic region where you can ship through the Arctic and say it's his like Nature's building the equivalent of the Panama Canal through the Arctic right now as we're seeing it and nobody expected that for 40-50 years it is happening right now in some countries are paying attention like Russia others like the United States simply aren't we still don't have you know a modern ice cutter to to even one up there we haven't run it through the Pentagon that's why I have a project or something like that it would actually the one I asked her was a coast guard my scar spend years my life the National Science Foundation trying to convince Congress to to to do that I rest my case Studios and you know and then the Russians actually planted a flag on the then they put a little flag on a Arctic sea bed about 10 years ago and then the Scandinavian countries know this next big area they all and it's in one of the other than the sinus node as well the scientist have documented recalled regime shifts in the Arctic and what that means and it's happening right now is one sort of like grass on to become another entire ecosystem it's all happening right before our eyes story I read today that goes Washington Post and not quite sure where that the Trump Administration came out with a report last month that predicts the planets going to warm under the 7 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century and much worse than we thought but they're using report to justify freezing Auto efficient fuel efficiency standards by basically saying hey you know it's going to happen that's actually a shot and shocking that that that was in that report and that's the justification what they're doing is there basically saying it's a fatalistic approach into their simplest thing with United States can't make a dent in this problem that what that there now and I'll pick knowledge and giving us they're trying to freeze these odd that you and and and Presa clean car standards what is a while to say what's wrong about that what's wrong headed about that is that America has to be a leader on this fight and in when America leaves everybody else follows on this particular issue so get this throwing up your hand and saying we can't you know making dent in it doesn't make any sense but more importantly I think what they technologist in that when this gets to court and it will get to court this probably is is the linchpin for why the loose if things are one of the lunch plans for a while I looked at that combined with the fact that nobody wants cities in America to get dirtier again talk to be underwater degrees Fahrenheit is climate change impacts are here right now the it it's not a it's not a distant threat in space and time it is here right now including even in America we need to recognize that and that there are things that we collectively can do can individuals really Absolutely I'll just give you one example even a simple thing like science is now emerging that says if everybody starts to build green backyards and green their local part of the world collectively that are dads up to a large carbon sink so that's just one example it's the kind of thing that's in it in the book project drawdown right but there are things like that that individuals can do they will have a meaningful infant impacted collectively they can also vote and what I'm in there two ways to vote you can vote for the government's tit actor don't act but you can also go to the consumer so if it could their big companies that are looking at meaningful sustainability practices find out who they are and and vote for them as a as a consumer so but with your your political nothing but with your pocketbook all right baby we're going have you stay to the brakes hang around a little bit longer with Jeff that Nesbitt is author of this is the way the world ends how do droughts and diop's heat waves and hurricanes are convergent American I tell you they want to read the first half of the book I was ready to give up don't give up don't give up that's like a physician yet you present the problem and then you get the treatment plan and you but you remain optimistic optimistic that if we have enough time to right the ship I do with not a whole lot of time but yes and we are going to write this ship a car number 844-724-8255 you can also tweeted at SCI Fri for psychic if you prefer on the telephone I'll be right back after this break stay with us this is Science Friday on Myra Play-Doh were talking about climate change and conflict and water shortages as a new national International problem with a Jess Jeff Nesbitt is author of this is the way the world ends and our number 844-724-8255 I said we take some phone calls we have a lot of interesting ones let's go to South Bend Indiana Gabriel hi welcome to Friday I think she can my call I love your show that office Not only was recommending a waste-to-energy project but a water recycling project and it wasn't the community that was pushing back it was actually the responsibility of administration a couple years ago was to eliminate the energy office I'm sort of push back and show the office was eliminated and those two ideas just died on the vine when the office was like a box being yeah that's so that's really unfortunate ization is responsible for New Movement called the we are still on movement that includes hundreds of Mayors and I think there lots of mirrors are freaking is Apple what is unfortunate about what your call just talked about is that there's a lots of money to be made in both Energy Efficiency and water recommended Reclamation they are smart they can figure out there just as companies are there is money to be made and sustainability I also wanted to shout out to Feller Hoosier cuz I grew up right down the road in Fort Wayne Indiana some Denver let's go to Keith in Denver Colorado ID hey good afternoon gentlemen up did we drop you off I'm sorry your phone is coming in and out start over for Denver Water and we have our own Breeze plant where we recycle water coming out the water treatment plant and so that that gets goes out to areas for irrigation the city golf courses city parks etcetera or at the prior to that occurring that was treated water there was going out there for irrigation so that there's cost-saving measure their work or not wasting treated treated water potable water to put on nail courses and Recreation areas couple other different things are doing now is even in line turbines on some of our high-flow conduits to produce electricity outside of are hydroelectric plants that are have been in place for years interesting fact of all the states and all the way down through Mexico that are all talking to each other about the Colorado River Basin they're getting very smart about it they're looking at you know the proper uses and they've all agreed effectively if the water tables get to Lone the Colorado River that those Upstream won't drain the water and everybody will conserve along the way it sits really heartening and some of the reasons why I'm so optimistic it's hard to see the people are getting this now they're looking at potential water scarcity issues right now, at the Colorado River Basin States and compacts are leading the way in that regard I will say others are as well you know Israel for instance is starting to export at some water desalinization technology even to Arab countries to Saudi Arabia maybe getting its fresh water from technology that, Israel company is rid of some things have developed the salinization at at the point where it can be done efficiently in large-scale it can be done it can be done let's put it that way fishing Lee large-scale and it's still an open question is still awfully expensive, but four countries like Saudi Arabia they may not have a choice in terms of drinking water there their they're going to have to do this Saudi Arabia can afford it because they they transfer there always or a while but countries like you no they can't they're out of luck but you still remain optimistic Google was born within 10 years I mean big the tech industry was born within 10 to 15 years up ended other big Industries in and come pick up ended the media industry in a very short period of time we're seeing two Trends right now we're seeing potential the end of the internal combustion engine and we're seeing that the rise of distributed solar power everywhere both of those things in my opinion will accelerate very very quickly in the next 10 years we need them to accelerate that quickly and if they do and if there's money in the system that changes the Energy System we can we can get this done and then you combine that with my faith and scientist to look at Carbon capture and even carbon drawdown out of the air over time I believe we can solve this problem it's a very Wicked dilemma but I have faith scientists ability to study this and and and come up with answers and the pan people's ability to make money from your new Energy Systems a new transportation system so you can read them more about this and Jeff and Spitzer new book this is the way in the world ends and I'll drown sand die-offs heat waves and hurricanes are converging on American look at the half of those kind of things but there's a lot of all thank you and you're also executive director climate Nexus a nonprofit that focuses on climate change Communications thanks for thanks for joining us today. Thanks for having me you're probably played the game where you try to spot different shapes or animals in the clouds clouds are good for that because they come in all kinds of different shapes and textures from puppy cumulus to Krispy cirrus clouds just last week I saw my first flying saucer Cloud the lenticular cloud but scientists look the clouds for a different reason they can tell us about the Dynamics of the atmosphere the physics of water droplets on a tiny scale NASA send up a balloon to capture images of one of the rarest clouds something called electric blue or polar mesosphere clouds they form way up in the sky 50 miles up and start around well specs of meteor dust four nuclei my next guess are going to tell us about these elusive electric blue polar mesosphere clouds let me introduce them David Fritz is the principal investigator of NASA's PMC turbo Mission and founder and manager Global atmospheric technology and Sciences Inc which is headquartered in Newport News Virginia carry Thomas's co-investigator at NASA's aeronomy of ice in the mesosphere and professor emeritus of atmospheric sciences at the University of Colorado in Boulder welcome both of you to Science Friday thank you I already tried to do with you not a Lucent I get that right what do they let no no no no no not to Luso knock too but I haven't bought out what do they look like can we see them here in New York what do you find them know you have to go past the Canadian border is latitude also you need to go up in summertime and stay around until dusk or get up very early in the morning to see them because they're very thin and so you can only see them when the sky background is dark that's interesting and they are really electric blue well yes but they just really it's just scattered sunlight but they appear that way because the black background they just appear almost illuminist it looks like almost like they're emitted light themselves but they're not they're just scattered sunlight and I got you in the past there's been some debate about how these clouds form maybe from meteorite dust is that right yes I think maybe Dave fritts could talk a little bit more about that well do meteors come in they a blade at high altitudes of the lead to many many very tiny particles and because their sedimentation is so small it takes a very long time for them to settle out of the atmosphere and so nucleation sites are preferred locations for the creation of a water droplets in and ice particles and so when the temperature is sufficiently cold that happens rattly know what's really unique about this portion of the atmosphere is that even though it is continuously illuminated by the Sun during the summer of high latitudes it's by far the coldest place on the planet can't it's it's hard to think of clouds that's been developed 15 Mi at the edge of space some people consider that to be the case yes but they're very tiny particles and so they are Boyd up they maintain their altitude to some degree I buy the larger scale atmospheric dynamics that cause upwelling of the atmosphere so there is a turtle a 5 centimeter per second General upward flow and so that helps preserve the particles have those altitudes you came up with this idea that sort of serendipitously are you because you noticed it was Gunk on a camera now deceased but he did that they really pioneering studies of noctilucent clouds really 60 years ago he actually did stereo viewing from the ground but his cameras were of course not what we have available to us now and he remarkably identified the cheat on Amex in the altitude and other things that were proven later on but what is really exciting about this particular Cloud layer is that it is very thin in many cases and so it acts as a really spectacular Tracer for really small scale motions in the atmosphere that would seem insignificant but I really globally very important zactly how high this is the jet stream is sort of that aircraft altitudes so commercial aircraft flying around 11 km balloon flew on a high-altitude balloon at 38 km so Three Times Higher and it had to look up another 50 kilometers to see the pmc's above it so why are you why are you so interested in this place clouds Cloud later this to my passion is small-scale waves and instabilities that transition to turbulence and what is really remarkable about the PMC layer at very high altitudes is that I would argue that although it is very remote it is almost certainly the very best place to study those processes on the planet for the same reason the physics excites me to I'm a physicist but I'm also interested in the aspect of climate climate change because there is so I think we're pretty strong evidence now that these things I have not been around for a long time in fact in 1885 they were first reported in the in the literature and reflect it a lot of reports going back into the 19th century and no reports whatsoever very thing resembling this kind of phenomenon cell all right it is that these clouds are actually produced by methane or at least indirectly caused by methane increases which have more than doubled over the past Century Century and a half and sent a methane is that is composed of carbon and four hydrogen atoms and this disk decomposes in the upper atmosphere to form water vapor which in turn collects on the meteor dust particles so that's if they have methane doubled that means if he knocked loose some clouds also must have doubled and so another aspect is that is that the and 1885 there were fantastic read that sunsets during that time because of the Krakatoa eruption that occurred 2 years before that so are we propose that it was it was the Krakatoa eruption that cause these things to be discovered discovering quotes for the first time I just think it's the Science Friday from WNYC Studios talking with the Gary Thomas and Deborah princess of Gary do you think these clients can be used as a measure of climate change the formation of Isis is exquisitely sensitive to temperature changes and also to a lesser extent water vapor so both of those quantities that temperature and water vapor are changing in the upper atmosphere and as a result of climate change to the point where we see them more visually for the general public they get to be so ubiquitous to a predicted that they would Advance slowly over the over the centuries but it's it's a pretty slow increase in activity so it's going to take probably another generation before they can be seen in fact they haven't seen over Southern Colorado casually they do they do make an advance toward the equator two it's perhaps that's a prediction my prediction yeah so how will you know that would be having them because of climate change so that's the idea I would like to see if we'd like to live to see that can what what kind of things do else do you wanna know well the principal processes that were interested in studying are small-scale waves we call them gravity waves that are excited by Deep convection they're excited by air flow over mountains but they have a unique ability to propagate to very high altitudes dry quickly and they communicate energy and momentum upward and so they're very important in the large-scale circulation of the atmosphere but they can't deposit the energy or the momentum until they dissipate and so they have to do that by instabilities in turbulence and those processes are really pretty understood and one of the motivations for understanding the minimum motivations for the various agencies funding these things is that if we can better understand these processes we likely will be in a better position to predict weather and climate so that those would be some of the very significant outputs of this down the road potentially why I'm so so wait where do you go from here what do you want to do you know how do you follow up on it well we have a gigantic amount of data we flew seven cameras on the balloon and a lighter that was provided to buy the German Aerospace Center so we have really Exquisite measurements we have a suite of seven cameras for four large fields of you and three narrow fields of you span a region of the sky from about 500 km across and the high resolution of the camera is allows us to see scales as small as about 10 or 20 M so this is really I think of remarkable experiment it's the only place I believe on the planet where there is the potential to see that much variability and then particularly exciting thing about this mission is it lost it lets us watch the flow of energy from the waves that bring it to those altitudes all the way through the instabilities and to the turbulence and it highlights the specific process by which that happens which we have a difficult time seeing anywhere else can I can't send it some it up any better than that David Fritz principal investigator of NASA's PMC turbo Mission and Gary Thomas call investigator messing around on me if I seen the mesosphere thank you both for taking time to do this today scrap yard podcast BJ leiderman composer theme music and of course everyday is Science Friday or active all week and all kinds of smart players and all our social media have a great weekend I'm out of Play-Doh in New York I hear the host of future at heart a new podcast by Target and WNYC creative about people and organizations were fighting for a better future on the show I travel the country and meet people who are doing the work that changes communities like Hector Avila and Houston Texas he's helping the US soccer foundation and tar transform unused Urban Land into safe soccer play spaces for the community to listen to this episode and others download Future it hard wherever you
