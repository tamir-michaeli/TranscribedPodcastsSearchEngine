Life as a West Virginia coal miner in the early 20th century meant living at the mercy of coal companies tools and lived in company housing wages were often paid in scrip this was credit that could only be used at company-owned stores and trying to organize for better working conditions medrisk King eviction unemployment and violence Cooperators wanted to stamp out any effort of the miners to unionize and there was a private Army at their disposal this included local police paid to harass Union organizers and armed mind-guards from the baldwin-felts detective agencythe many miners were determined to organize for better pay and working conditions to end Violence by mind-guards and to be able to join the union songwriter Walter Seacrest describe the minor story in the lyrics of his song law in the West Virginia Hills these miners got together one warm July day they laid away their tools and struck for better pay than the cruel company gun men with officers from all around came and drove them from the houses through their stuff out on the ground the early 1900 saw several violent clashes between Miners and coal company guards the governor of West Virginia even declared martial law three times add on August 24th 1921 a few thousand miners gathered at Lynn's Creek in Kanawha County West Virginia they were determined to March the 65 miles south towards Logan County to rescue miners there who have been jailed and abused for trying to unionize a local union official name of Bill blizzard officially led the miner Army in response the coal companies on the governor quickly assembled the state police a citizen militia and the mind guards as the arm minors march to Logan County their numbers grew to several thousand both sides met at Blair Mountain for what would become known as the West Virginia mine War many on both sides were injured and several people were killed although the exact number isn't clear the governor of West Virginia as President Harding to intervene and he did Harding sent more than 2,000 federal troops who arrived to Blair Mountain on September 3rd 1921 the miners many of the World War 1 veterans are reluctant to take up arms against the troops have returned home the next year several hundred of the miners who fought in the mind War found themselves facing criminal charges for their participation a large group of these criminal cases were moved far from the coal fields to another County prosecutors who also happen to be cold company lawyers agreed to try Bill blizzard first he was after all the leader of the battle of Blair Mountain and the charge treason treason against the state of West Virginia the States Constitution said that treason against the state shall consist only in levying war against or in a shearing to its enemies giving them Aid and comfort West Virginia like Most states in the United States punishes treason as a crime so does the Federal Constitution the term treason has come up a lot these days many questions have been raised about President Trump's loyalties and where they lie about treason and what exactly does someone commit a treasonous act and when Trump tweets the single word treason with a? Probably in reference to the Anonymous New York Times op-ed is he using that word correctly well let's find out this is what Trump can teach us about con law and ongoing series of indefinitely we take the tweets of the 45th president of the United States and his critics and use them to examine our constitution like we never had before our music is from doing Jam records professor and neighbor is Elizabeth Joe and I'm your fellow student and host Roman Mars are you moaning for a time when politics was about something and made sense I recommend revisiting the Bartlett in ministration with the West Wing weekly that fictional president had a Nobel prize in economics what if I use the value that kind of thing The West Wing weekly is a great podcast about so much more than the TV show The West Wing find it at radiotopia. FM or wherever you get Podcast the Constitution is fairly specific for a change about treason article 3 section 3 says that treason against the United States shall consist only in levying war against them or in a hearing to their enemies giving them a dime comfort and a constitution also requires a pretty high standard of proof that same section says that no person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same over attacked or on confession in open court it's not a particularly new crime the punishment of treason goes back centuries and English law what is treason exactly as a constitution defines it there are two ways to be convicted of treason let's take the first way it's treason to Levy war against the United States well there aren't that many legal decisions about what this means the Supreme Court has said that levying War means that there must be an actual assemblage of men for the purpose of executing a treasonable design probably the best interpretation of what this means is that levying war refers to the use of some kind of force by a group of people so conventional Wars like World War would count but what about other man's after all muskets and cannons are the only way to wage war today what about a Cyber attack from a foreign nation in theory that could count imagine a cyber-attack that would shut down the entire power grid in the United States or even worse explode Ireland missiles on American soil the federal government could treat a cyberattack as an act of War but it hasn't done that so far The Constitution's trees and Claws also says that treason can be committed by adhering to the enemies of the United States by giving them a tan Comfort when you first hear that phrase you might think that it's pretty easy to be guilty of treason if you help out Nations whose interests or at least sometimes hostile to the United States take Russia or China probably never Canada but that's not really what an enemy of the United States is for the purposes of a constitution is trees on Claws and enemy would be a nation or an organization that were this it's not enough for a country to be an adversary and trade or and political interest remember even during the Cold War we weren't formally at war with the Soviet Union and we're not currently in a conventional war with any Nation it's possible to say that we're currently at war with organizations like Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State so right after the Attacks of September 11th 2001 Congress approve the use of military force against anyone responsible for this attacks or anyone who hated them and that authorization is still in effect on closer examination it turns out that the constitution defines the crime of treason pretty narrow e and only a few people have ever actually been convicted of the federal offense of treason in our nation's history and most of them were eventually pardoned or released no one person has ever been executed for treason even though Congress is authorized the death penalty as a possible punishment for the crime now that doesn't mean that the crime itself is actually on comment if you think about it all of the thousands of men who fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War and everyone who helped the Confederacy was guilty of treason these people either did Levy war against the United States or provided Aid and comfort to the enemy which in this case was the Confederacy so let's get to Trump more than a year-and-a-half into his presidency there have been many many questions about Trump's ties to Russia let's consider some examples there continue to be more Revelations and denials about what was said in the June 2016 meeting between members of the Trump campaign and a Kremlin connected lawyer on August 5th Trump tweeted fake news reporting a complete fabrication that I am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son Donald had in Trump Tower this was a meeting to get information on an opponent totally legal and done all the time and politics and it went nowhere I did not know about it what is a Mueller investigation Trump has tweeted many versions of the kind of tweet he posted on August 1st this is a terrible situation and attorney general Jeff sessions should stop this rig Witch Hunt right now before it continues to stay in our country any further Bob Mueller is totally conflicted and his 17 angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work or a disgrace to USA and there's Paul manafort the president's former campaign manager on August 21st jury in Virginia found manifold guilty of eight counts of financial crimes including bank and tax fraud your face is another trial on charges from the special counsel's office that includes money laundering and failing to register as a foreign agent and manafort's ties to the Kremlin have been widely reported course there's Helsinki July 16th Trump met with Russian President Putin for a summit in Helsinki Finland shortly before the summit began Trump tweeted our relationship with Russia has never been worse thanks too many years of us foolishness stupidity and now the Red Witch Hunt the Russian foreign Ministry is official Twitter account retweeted that tweet and added we agree we don't know what was said between Trump and Putin during their 2-hour meeting the only American representative present besides the president was his interpreter but we do know what happened during their joint press conference afterwards a reporter from the Associated Press As Trump just now President Putin denied having anything to do with the election interference in 2016 every us intelligence agency has concluded that Russia did my first question for you sir is who do you believe my second question is would you now with the whole world watching tell President Putin would you denounce what happened in 2016 and would you warn him to never do it again Trump responded I have President Putin he just said it's not Russia I will say this I don't know any reason why it would be Trump that added I have great confidence in my intelligence people but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today American responses were immediate and alarmed the late Senator John McCain tweeted that same day today's press conference in Helsinki was one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory and the former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said in a TV interview more and more I come to the conclusion that after the Helsinki performance and sends that I really do wonder whether the Russians have something on him I think his behavior was just unbelievable and the very next day on July 17th Trump clarified his Helsinki comments at the White House here's what he said now I have to say I came back and I said what is going on what's the big deal so I got a transcript I reviewed it I actually went out and reviewed a clip of the answer that I gave and I realize that there is a need for some clarification it should have been obvious as I thought it would be obvious but I would like to clarify just in case it wasn't I said the word wood instead of wouldn't the sun should have been I don't see any reason why I wouldn't or why it wouldn't be Russia so just to repeat it I said the word wood instead of wind the sentence should have been I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be Russia sort of a double negative so you can put that and I think that probably clarifies things pretty good by itself to the president's critics this clarification wasn't entirely comforting to the Constitution is President Trump committing treason if his remarks and other evidence would indicate that he is or was working with the Russian government for Russian interest would that be treasonous the short answer is probably not remember that the constitution defines treason narrowly let's return to the two ways that reason can be committed either you Levy war against the United States or you provide Aid and comfort to our enemies so the problem here is that we're not actually at war with Russia in fact we are formally at peace with Russia if President Trump were to take actions or adopt policies that appear disloyal to the United States even shockingly disloyal this still would not amount to treason what about the second means of committing treason providing Aid and comfort to your enemies right after the Helsinki Summit former director of the CIA John Brennan send it a TV interview the Trump's remarks were a betrayal of the nation he is giving Aid and comfort to the enemy Arizona Senator Jeff Flake describe the press conference as a moment when the president let down the Free World by giving Aid and comfort to an enemy of democracy so the estate is Echo the aid and comfort language of the trees on Klaus and of course it's a dramatic way to criticize the president but it still doesn't mean that Trump has committed treason again the main problem is that Russia is not a formal enemy of the United States so even if there is eventually evidence to show that Trump actively conspired with Russia knowingly received help from Russia evenhouse for help from Russia to win the presidency and maybe even to make executive policy this still doesn't qualify as treason of the Constitution of course that doesn't mean that President Trump is in the clear legally speaking we don't yet know what special counsel Mueller and his team have found regarding ties between Russia and the Trump campaign and there are plenty of non-russian legal troubles for the president as well on August 21st the same day that jury found Paul manafort guilty the presidents former personal lawyer fixer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to Breaking campaign Finance laws in open court, and said he broke the law at the direction of a candidate for federal office personally that was President trap so depending on the evidence Trump's activities with Russia and Siri might constitute violations of other laws including election fraud conspiracy to defraud the United States computer hacking and other criminal laws but it doesn't amount to treason what happened to Bill blizzard the union official charged with treason against the state of West Virginia on May 27th 1922 a jury acquitted blizzard of treason only one of the thousands of men involved in the West Virginia mine war was actually convicted of treason a coal miner named Walter Allen Allen was sentenced to 10 years in prison but while he was out on bond Allen fled the county he was never heard from again Virginia single a state but my my understanding is that most of the states do punish the crime of treason against the state so I don't think that prosecution's are very common and I would I would assume that convictions or even rear but I think that West Virginia mine were cases gives you a good sense of why it can be a dangerous crime to use political yeah we look back in history and think wow that was a really unfair hits of the trees and Claws but it was using situated try and punish these miners were unionizing they were really against the state of West Virginia know they weren't trying to Levy war against the state of West Virginia they wanted to unionize is written into state constitutions how do you define an enemy estate inside of United States yeah I don't know if there's a whole lot about it and it's one of these like forgotten areas of the law like I said part of it is I think there are that many prosecutions that we know about the results date recent causes I don't know I mean in the West Virginia case there was a sense that there was kind of a crisis in West Virginia politics and public life because of this battle essentially between civilians and the police and so the prosecutors argued that was an act of war against the state itself it's hard to imagine that they would be another similar kind of occurrence happening with enough regularity that we could release us out what state trees in means but it's early and unusual set of circumstances and yes those trees and laws exist in the important thing to keep in mind is that the word treason keeps coming up a lot and people love to say right after Helsinki treason was one of the most commonly looked up words and a Merriam-Webster but it really doesn't matter you know what play matters is for purposes of constitutional law is there anything that we've known about so far that might constitute reason on the part of the present and the answer is no to have trees is not just a gut feeling kind of crime you actually have to follow what the Constitution says and you know no matter how badly the evidence might show at some point in the future that you know Trump has done things that would appear perhaps disloyal to our American interest to know what it means to be an American president that could be the basis of impeachment possibly it could possibly be the subject of a criminal prosecution but then one runs into the problems of whether it's okay to indict a president but they certainly don't amount of treason and that doesn't say anything about how Siri those actions would be but that we've made a choice that reason has to satisfy a very stringent set of circumstances all the people that many people think wow they were treasonous like the rosenbergs for example can actually charge of trees anywhere tried on other criminal offenses cultural idea like wow that's treasonous Behavior but we actually don't have that many instances of treason prosecution's really you need an enemy to a cracked reason and if we don't technically have an enemy and prosecution another country might see is an act of War right like if you said we're fine is treason prosecution against someone and this other than the you know whatever filiation to devote other country that country might say are you saying we are the anatomy of the United States again that's a total loss goal kind of hypothetical that you can see the problem there we don't actually have Rush as a formal enemy we want to believe that somehow trees and amounts to being disloyal to our interests and that's the conversational understanding of treason but it's not the Constitutional meaning of treason this shows produced by Elizabeth Joe and me Roman Mars special thanks to
