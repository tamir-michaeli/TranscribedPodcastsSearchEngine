ACastofKingsSeason7Review
missed connection that means I haven't seen before can imagine you and I need lately feels like a need you go to pretty much all the time hello everyone and welcome to a cast of kings and unofficial podcast about the HBO Original Series Game of Thrones I'm David Jen and I haven't read most of the books in George RR Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire book in George RR Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire episodes of Game of Thrones podcast. Com email us a cast of Kings at gmail.com find us on Facebook and Twitter at a cast of Kings what we do here usually this podcast is me recap every episode of Game of Thrones but we don't spoil anything from future which episodes of course we are at the end of season 7 so there's no next time on preview we don't know what's really going to happen in the books so we really can't spoil that much in the future but we thought we would do this week is weed follow up on things we missed discussing for our season 7 finale review just a few loose ends we wanted to pick up and then after that we wanted to get to your emails we asked me to send an email as hundreds of you did and it was awesome hearing your Reflections on the season what you really enjoyed what you fuck have been better was so awesome to read all those and of course you can always email also the cast of Kings at gmail.com now before I just wanted to mention to know what the plan is going forward for the future again I mention this last week but we are not planning on doing any broadcast until the season 8 premiere maybe we'll do it like a recap episode before that and we don't know when the season 8 premiere will be right it's very likely going to be 20 19 it looks like right all right cracked the biggest break ever between Game of Thrones seasons the biggest break ever between cast of Kings episodes so it'll be awhile before you hear from us again but of course you can always follow us in the meantime John I thought we just tell people where they can find us right now and it for the next year-and-a-half your work on the internet you can let find me rambling about all kinds of things on Twitter at jowrotethis you can find me on Vanity Fair.

Net follow me on Twitter at Dave chinski that's Dave Chan s k y a surgeon of the podcast called calm one of the thing I want to mention before we get started today and that's the music that opens and closes this week's episode of a cast of Kings now buffering the Vampire Slayer did create one of the songs that kicked off our season and they also graciously agreed to write the music for this week's episode of the show and you have some familiarity and and relationship with the awesome Folks at buffering the Vampire Slayer right Jenny Owen Youngs and Kristen Russo who are just the living best and if you like Buffy the Vampire Slayer should goes in there podcast but they were kind enough to Grace us with some music this season at my request and at least one of the songs is about a character a lot of us are missing I think this season episode of the podcast and to find out more about what they do go to buffering the Vampire Slayer comp will also include links in the show notes as to where you can find more information about this music cuz we got a lot of request the few times we had music about you know where can I find more where can I get this music listen to this music working to support these people who make this music so we'll have leaks in the shower I said you all that stuff let's get to follow ups from season 7 finale of Game of Thrones so there's a few things that had come up on the it's over the last week and I didn't have a chance to talk with you about that because we had so much to discuss during their season 7 finale episode and now I finally have a chance to look at Jury 8 in these topics one of them is just ridiculous Siri that's been going around that brand is somehow the night king and a lot of people have been speculating that this might be true it's kind of I guess it would make the show more if you know what I eat whenever I see a theory like this I think to myself does this make you feel better or does it make it more if he medically interesting I guess it could I guess I could but it just feels like so little textual evidence has occurred on the show that I don't know how anyone could reasonably think this break it down why do people think Brad might be the night King and why do you I'm guessing think he's not this is not just like this is Ben I don't know if I think they're like half the season people been on this beat my least favorite area since the since I was pregnant. like they said I'm not as certain that this one is wrong as I was last time because of exactly what you said what does make a show worse and I'm like this might not make a show where it's because we have worried about the final season in the night King potentially being the main villain and is he completely boring and uninteresting villain because you can't talk he's just an elemental force of evil would it be more interesting if he were actually someone we knew if that person's brand some how would that make sure where I'm staying and I'm like yeah kind of we would end and I understand the impulse behind this because I think it is people trying to figure out something good to do with brick making more interesting than just dropping Exposition bombs you know as as the show goes on Isaac hempstead-wright himself has and a couple interviews so to shut down this Theory that doesn't mean it's not true cuz you know that you know Kit Harington definitely said I'm dead not coming back again with her all the time but but Isaac hempstead-wright has been pretty like the actor who plays Bran and pretty like yeah this is a silly Terry is some of the evidence is a very silly like some like the night King and bran dress alike and I'm like you mean they wear like Killswitch 90% of the people on the show are like what are you talking about there's been some weird photoshopped evidence going around like someone Photoshop the night King's like Muhammad Ali and then I can wear someone like Photoshopped it on brand of people believed it and I was like oh my God how sad is your life that you need to like make fake news and manipulate evidence in order to spread a crackpot Theory which which lesser than our laws which is nice. The hundreds of hours talking about these kind of sad but like faking evidence some of the evidence has to do with like yeah they recast the actor who plays the night King they recast him in between season 5 season 6 the reason they gave is a theory with the after they had playing him before under all that makeup and CGI I had a previous commitment and so they just recast in the guy they recast under the makeup does look more like Isaac hempstead-wright in the garden but the thing is we saw a picture of the cast we saw him without that I can make up on being like created in a flashback where the lake the children for us were like putting dry glass in his chest and make him so we know what that guy looks like and that guy doesn't really look like brand and so it's not actually literally brand right that is that I can't because we saw who became the night King then the other theory is that Brad has an award into that guy like he had done to hold or in the past or something like that and I don't like that. Either because the whole idea behind it is like there two reasons one brand is gone full dr. Brad haddin and is tired of this planet and wants it all to end and so that's why he's working tonight king and the other one is he's genuinely they're trying to like do good but is being misunderstood and none of that make sense to me because like brave enough to take a really hard pivot in the final season to get there and I don't think you can interpret all the death and destruction that the night King is bringing as I'm sort of misguided attempt to heal the world right all that being said I think it's possible that the night King is a brand I think we talked about this before in the past that there are a lot of bran Stark's throughout history one of them helps build the wall the night King in the HBO series predates The Wall so he could be a different brand Stark and maybe learning something about that will give him some interesting background but I I I feel I think that the odds I gave on my other podcast Arma spoilers in terms of believing this. 85% I'm leaving some room at 85% that it's true or false you know I've known you to have many crackpot theories that turned out to be true so why is this one that one of the least favorite is it just yeah just like a really lack of textual evidence as opposed to you like I don't know the crockpot stuff around West world where you can point you a bunch of things or the truth of Jon Snow's parentage there are a lot of textual clues for that this would seem like a twist out of nowhere not to say that the show is about that sort of thing these days but it is if it turns out to be true it is so big that it will have to have been something that George RR Martin came up with I don't think the show is going to go so Rogue off the books as to do this the problem is in the books the night king is not even a character that is ever shown up or anything like that and so there is no just feels very unlike you I was going to try to do spiny and Joanna sense but it didn't work it set off the jodas fighter sets as something that's another reason I say least favorite is just cuz it's very very popular just like the Santas pregnancy Terry was just means that I get like 900 tweet today about it and I heard email today about it so don't feel bad if you sent me one of those are we didn't answer earlier then couple minutes before just going to believe it up until it's proven untrue like unlike the Santa thing like she eventually people dropped at the season because she's not showing and so they're like oh I guess that's not true but people are just going to believe this there is true until the until the show like definitively proves it's not true and that I feel like we won't get till the very end so we've got two years of off-season where we going to be like but what if I listen because what if you're right you might be also you seem to indicate that the show will definitively proven not true which may not happen maybe we'll get you into the show and people will still believe it and it'll be like this crazy fan Theory makes the Game of Thrones better if you think about it like this you know we'll see those buzzfeed.com King probably not true lot of people still believe about another thing that I saw pop up a lot was the Stark sigil Theory the idea that the whites and the white walkers at the end of season 7 when they were marching over the remains of eastwatch they formed a stark sigil as viewed from above and see what you thought cuz I'll just say me personally I did not see it myself but I've looked at I think 70 evidence I've looked in the screen shots but did you see your Stark sigil in the formation of the whites in the white walkers I think it's like a Rorschach test I can be there if you want it to be there or like looking at Clouds you know what I mean I don't feel like this to fit it anyway even if it is that definitely prove to you the bread is the night King like I don't win Jon Snow die at the end of season 5 there was a lot of analysis of the shape that has blood made in the snow and some people saw the wolves are people so Dragonwings like they thought it was some sort of indication that like this is this is a hint of his parentage or something like that maybe confirm that they did something like that with the blood maybe they do something that with the army of the dead or maybe they wouldn't I I feel kind of agnostic on this it's possible that it could mean a million everything I don't see myself that being said we do know that white walkers have been known to make weird ass formations of things as viewed from above as we saw it earlier seasons of the show so it's not totally outside the realm of possibility but yeah Jules in white formations is the new seeing Jesus in peanut butter sandwiches I think and it makes people feel good so who are we to rain on their parade speaking of bran can bran Warg into an ice dragon this is something that a lot of people have tweeted at more than one person at sweet and I feel like like why does the branches worgen what ice dragon and the whole battle right there any thoughts on that you wanna one of my long-held favorite theories is that you know there's this whole Dragon Rider Theory the dragon has three heads a lot of people thought it was good to meet you and Jon and Daenerys now people think is going to be like Daenerys Jon and then I King has the surprise spoiler third head but I think it's Daenerys Jon and brand wart into Syrian Ivo I have a long time thought that Brandon was a third dragon dragon rider metal oxide couple years and I I think there's all the stuff either the three-eyed Raven said to Brandon when he was training at the weirwood tree you will never walk again but you will fly and that could be like you'll go into birds and play around but I've always thought that he would take over the mind of a dragon so you might invite it that way so you actually think that he will work into an ice dragon then and one of the things that a lot of people sent to you by email and I Twitter is we discovered during the season 7 finale of Game of Thrones that John's true name is aegon Right Jon Snow he's his father rhaegar who's secret married lyanna they had John and name to Megan and lock questions about the fact that didn't rhaegar already have a child named aegon why would he name two children are gone so yeah that's a question I want to ask for you too and I like I had that? Why are the what is have two children named aegon operations that happened yes yes died at the Trident in battle but like okay Leon is pregnant then they are happens what happens to the landing after that and that means that his first wife Lilia and his two children Egger egg on Andreas die the mountain kills them or other limbs are soldiers so and then Jon Snow is born and lyanna dies his dad and the first Akon's Dad when Don snow was born so it's possible Italy on a new all that here's the here's a? Big? All this how was the Raven service at the tower of joy we don't know we don't know what Liana new when Jon Snow was right but if she knew that the first if she knew both the trigger was dead which I'm guessing she did and that the first egg on was dead then maybe she didn't the child as I don't know I know much do that and I think it's more accurate to say that Liana name the baby then regular day the baby is rhaegar was dead accurate sandwich I was not accurate right want to name like the prince who was promised rhaegar was a complete Nut Job about prophecies so it's even possible that he would name both of his sons egg on someone sent us a long email I think it was too cast of Kings about the historical precedents of European monarchs having like two children in the same thing in the same family so this is like a thing that happened in actual medieval or later history so all of that it's weird but not so weird that I don't buy it but I also kind of think at the same time but that won't be his name in the book so because there's a different character named aegon Targaryen and that's not in the show in a box but like yeah there's already a character named aegon Targaryen who is going to be making claims to the throne in the book that character I am a thousand percent sure is not showing up in the show so I kind of feel like they're going to make John play that role. But even he wasn't having two sons name the same thing is not weird in you know in the context of these kinds of shows or lineages or or you know six sessions or whatever so this is well all season we've been talking about how the Winterfell plot line is kind of weak to us kind of feels like the character motivations are really well established in develop but apparently there's a deleted scene in season 7 finale that clears things up a little bit right there right there she plays Bran give a bunch of interviews but you many many outlets and was like very eager to talk about the one thing he did it all over the place which is that there's the deleted scene from the finale which had since I'm obviously going to Brandon I don't think we have to see much of it we just see her going to Brandon being like I need your help with something and then we don't see what she asks him but then we cut to the throne room scene and so then when they start like talking about all the things that Littlefinger date it's maybe a little clearer that they had downloaded all this information from from brand of pedia or whatever but what it does actually even better clear up is sort of what's Anthony on when she knew it and I think what it indicates to me and this is also based on something that the director of the finale Jeremy it also said an interview what it indicates to me is I don't know if I don't know if I talked about this on our last episode but that Aria and Little Finger were genuinely fighting were genuinely pitted against each other because a little finger and it wasn't until the finale that sounds of figured out that little finger was running a game on her and once you figure that out that's when she went to Brian and that's when we had the throne room scene and I feel like the reason they cut that scene was to preserve more of an element of surprise for the final throne room and that was the reason why a lot of the clumsiness in Winterfell happened was all for that leg is bleeding or is it something that the Breaking Bad writers used to do all the time but like not everyone I think is well suited for it and it would make you feel like that's exactly what they did I think both of us would guess that that's exactly have this was done they said that they knew that the last scene of the Season would be the night King taking down the wall whether or not on a debt under dragon I don't know but if if the whole thing is like how does that I can get an undead dragon and they have to do calculus and what they came up with was the white hunt which you and I both had issues with then you know maybe that's got maybe that's not their strong suit is is working backwards but the winter I think that deleted Branzino would have atleast cleared up a little bit of the wonderful plot but it still would have been it still would have really not set well with me how long will fingers game worked on Arya and Sansa with like such little effort on his behalf really do you know so expensive Santa saying Littlefinger shit doesn't work on me like she is she's been like 3 episodes insisting he shouldn't work on her and then she twerks on her and I'm like that's just so I don't like that at all I mean I still don't know if I agree with your interpretation that in fact sensor was under Littlefinger spell until the last episode of cuz that was your interpretation right was that too yeah okay well then that really doesn't feel good to me at all that was the intention. I would prefer that it wasn't the intention it makes more sense to me that there are some of scheming in some way and maybe you communicating and coded language her in her and Aria but anyway spice to say that they're there still a bunch of little gaps that need to be filled in for that would you follow a plot in our opinion but the brand deleted scene does help a little bit with it so interviews if any and I'm eager to hear what she says about it let's move on to talk about listen our emails at a cast of Kings at gmail.com Jonah solo 2 emails this one concerns the three and Annie relationship lot of questions last week about why was Tyrion looking longingly wistfully at creepily at the door where Dany and Jon were consummating their attraction for each other and Colleen are rights in to Cascades gmail.com this is such an easy one that everyone has made way too complicated. Has made concerted and successful efforts at redirecting Danny away from relationships that leave her susceptible to the vulnerabilities of emotional ties he knows the risks involved in having emotional ties eyelash a n Taisha the moment she compromises her ultimate objective of winning the iron throne in order to preserve a person she loves is the moment she gives her an amazing opportunity to date her. Has seen this happened time and time his own father school tomorrow we have to quickly forgotten how Central these two tragic relationships are to his character the show me this point loud and clear in season one within the Executioner Ned Stark later again with Robins murder and countless times there after honor is a little more than a weapon that can be used against you know surprise me that you and looks for Lauren and I found a boat scene between John's bending of the knee his pronounce going to public loyalty to Danny and now the consummation of the relationship during can see the writing on the wall these two people whom he respects maybe making decisions more with their heart than with their head which could be the end of one or both of them for the whole dog gone wrong for that matter it doesn't feel good character for cheering to be jealous of a loss of political influence if he isn't even level them as well as building up to that reveal it does however seem completely in line with tyrion's character to limit watching some of your respects or loves choose the high road knowing it will alternately to their demise it seems to me he's always particular hated being witness to such Injustice is something you really want to talk about like Colleen do you agree with it I would say it's the best explanation I've heard so far that's what I think bringing up Shay and Tasha Tasha being TransForce wife like in and love is a bummer but like for cheese character to evolve to see that love is a vulnerability rather than something to be pursued it does make sense to me it doesn't really fall in line with what he said to Daenerys and insects or he's like he wasn't the first man to love you and you won't be the last about Dario like he just sort of seems to be maybe was lying to her promising like more loving her future director Jeremy podeswa has sort of shot down the idea that train is like love Lauren at all in the hallway but but in that scene but then again Peter Dinklage did say in an interview before the season that hearing is spent with the nearest so honestly I kind of feel like there's a lot of possibilities unclear direction clear unsuccessful attempt to convey intention that scene was and I don't know that it's the fault of the director of that episode either you know I feel like it's a season-long issue rather than just that yeah I agree the scene is extremely confusing and that's why a lot of people have different interpretations of it but I think that you eat too late track for seem like that to happen and I don't think that happened to season angry and not not I'm not entirely blaming Jeremy podeswa but I will say that like whatever you know whatever I was like oh good God no that was never the intention that see and I'm like well if a lot of people take that then maybe that's why he wasn't done very well opens that her bedroom door to sort of inmate John she's looking down so like it seems as though she's expecting Tyrion or just like expecting her hand in a meeting planner that's all I mean but if she did. It would explain why he was like lingere creepily in the hallway like he's on his way to see her right not just like loitering and hallway intention to see her and then he sees John goes and he's like oh shit pedestrian like such a weird thing to be like oh we had a meeting you know it Siri and didn't make it to the meeting on time that's why he's like that feels like the least interesting interpretation to me but certainly possible I like it as a reason why he's in that hallway not that he just like loiter isn't always in the boat I don't know who is Mike Cherry less of a creep makes you know so big? To me still I'm not going to die on this pill that like Tyrion isn't like everyone's like oh you really believe that you're in love with Daenerys I don't I'm not going to die how to say there is a room for a lot of different interpretations hear that that he's in love with Daenerys and jealous is one that he sees political power slipping away from me and him is another that he doesn't want John to have any control over her or influence on her because John is not a kitty think Carrie is very impulsive and I think he's kind of dumb and really I think I think she's like a dumb northerner I think Jamie calls him sauces Dunn Brothers come up with a plan that gives the white walkers but still pretty dumb yep well not blow that planet blow that plan in front of Circe just cuz you can't keep your mouth shut about one little thing Jon Snow so because your honor so important but this idea that like at least rob it Robb Stark is a good parallel hear that like Rob following his heart or his like that you know lower organs led to his downfall and so that's that's not that's not the game politically you know and and tyrion's like let's let's all think politically here if that's what we need to do to win finger as well and his death in the season finale and what that means Mandy from New Jersey wrightson I've heard one or both of you occasionally the lament about the writing and story arcs for a little finger and very yes I agree they were two of my favorite characters during the early Seasons verus especially I think he's a character number 2 on the better on the show them the books list Ron is number one I don't think the writers are due this as subtlety has not been the streets lately but I like to think the characters have been left to rot as a result of their actions they were great players of the game in the Old World Order however they play the game and ushered in the New World Order of magic no rules of succession chaos and traditional has not having all the power they thought they were maybe the world if you believe versus motive would benefit by this new world order even if it is not the New World Order they were envisioning now they are left playing a game they are no longer masters of and they are struggling or dead they are the analog watch in the digital world or Clinton collapsing against Obama in the 2008 primary Jeb Bush's non-starter campaign in the 2016 versus Trump's if you want Republicans Apple to be non-partisan I think there's an even better example in modern days that's a republican-controlled Congress that cheered on Trump's Ascension only to see if a flummox and I'm at every turn from a you know I think that's another potential analog through a world how little fingers to Maya's happens that like you don't seem like they work back for backwards from a surprise if they want to pull off that she dies in season 7 rather than season H does seem very interesting thematically to me and I like math sort of argument that the reason we seeing the character such a great in which character like Varys so sideline season is because like they're just isn't as much room for what he does in this new world order at least on the team he's on I think you have a lot more to do on circe's team but the yeah it is really blessing to me and then one other thing that someone pointed out we had so many emails I really apologize that we don't have you know we couldn't address everything but one of my favorite you know we asked her predictions of who will live and who will die in The Final Season something someone said is that they wanted Searcy to live not because they were rooting for her because it was her to be the ultimate punishment for her to have like work so hard to get this power and then all this other stuff and then just you like watch everyone she loves and care about dying for her to be all alone and basically the queen of Ashes which is sort of a phrase that they talked about a lot like the queen of nothingness thirsty all alone and then that would be like the ultimate tragedy for Thursday not to die but to live and Rule nothing but this idea of Abu of the world that we thought we knew of Westeros which is the Game of Thrones the political machinations his his giving away tooth is larger conflict and he and plenty of political analog modern political analogues for that there but it's really fascinating to me and it makes me feel little better because my current area as to why Littlefinger in various don't work on the show anymore is because the writers don't know how to write them the way that Martin did and that it's Pat I think that's possible too because there is really interesting and different characters in little finger and it's not just you know there are characters that the show Runners that the writers on Game of Thrones can write very well tonight I think maybe various even though my point is that there is better than show the names of the books anyway what do you think this is a great Siri from Matt and I think that it reminds me of like there was a major character death of the wire that I'm not going to give away but it happened like season 3 season 4 like major character death and I remember when it happened I was really upset because I love that character but I was reading on Recaps and some reason the forums after word that this character had served their purpose and there was no reason for them to be on the show anymore I said that they were there to communicate an idea to have a tragic Arc and then they were done and I feel like that's kind of what Matt's email points to his that Littlefinger had a burp and maybe a one interpretation is that he had a really strong role in the old world but that in this new world where virtue actually has a place in the western society and there is room for Honor that there can't be someone like little finger you throw a monkey wrench in the works so I find there to be a lot to like about this Theory and interpretation of things and I would buy it I would buy I mean I think we'll see I kind of have to have a wait-and-see approach this Theory you know like next season will show that it's true or false I think but I think it's a great interpretation of events moving on we also got a bunch of emails about grayscale write the Jorah Mormont getting Grayskull them being cured of it subplot in this season was I don't know about confusing but just like Curious I love these emails both so much and I'm going to read the book of Luke Luke rights in curing Jorah greyscale was truly not just anti-climactic but anti dramatic I can understand wanting to get that character up and off back Danny but at least give some real consequences to Sam is Raz actions leading to kill your baby Sam contracted grayscale would be Game of Thrones at its most sadistic but if they wanted Lester ones perhaps an outbreak at the Citadel lead and be kicked out rather than just up and leaving or him being forcibly quarantine for a time to truly push his disillusionment before leaving would have worked so that's Luke writing into Cassidy's a Gmail account with a couple of suggestions for what might have made that Popeye better from Melbourne Australia Brighton like Arias face changing magic the specifics of Sam's ability to cure greyscale is very vague and unclear scraping some dead skin off and slapping some hummus dipping sauce apparently did the trick this isn't a problem for me though however what was the problem what did this grayscale plot ultimately due to serve the narrative as a whole will Sam head to old valyria and cure the grayscale men what kind of purpose will Sam's grayscale cure play in the war against the night night king of Grayskull has never been here before why hasn't Sam's efforts been lauded or giving more Praise by the masers of Old Town if you melt the heart in grayscale skins from yours body will it become before Europeans steal is your immunity from grayscale now and other diseases or Supernatural afflictions why didn't Dora mention anything about Santa John these are some of the questions lingering in my mind throughout the season and I was disappointed with the lack of payoff regarding this fall line why introduce a cure for greyscale and devote significant amount of screen time for it if it's plot wasn't going to go anywhere it seems as if the Raiders only gave Jorah greyscale as an excuse to temporarily write him out of the show because Iain Glen was too busy with other projects of the time and I'm rude and easy resolution to get him back to Danny what's the email from Kevin Haven from Melbourne Australia so thoughts of what the plot like what was the function of this grayscale purpose of grayscale was till I give Dora the sleep very tragic sad and or whatever you know you mean but like he was cured and I only was he cured is cured in like I mean it was it was disgusting and dramatic but also the kind of easier than we thought it would be considering that no one knows the cure for greyscale there has to be some other reason why I even happened to say also that the next day when he's cured seemingly it's like the next day right Sam scraping stuff off and then he's better than Next Day Air Spencer said you only have one night but I feel like you know that he discovered that the guy had no skin and so he let him like sit there until he grow new skin and then he's like oh huh between him saying one night and then the morning of like it it did seem like one night but okay let's say it was a couple nights I'm willing to grant that I'm sorry but if it was one night it would actually be very impossible because no one heals up fast from anything let alone a life-altering Affliction disease which is like 10 times debating elsewhere but like it's more like why start down this road and my guess is since a character who is written out of the show Jon connington in the books has this dramatic interaction like goes to valyria grapples with the stone-men gets greyscale you know they were like okay we should do that but we should do what your answer like when they're like oh we should do that but we should do it with Santa in terms of the Ramsey wedding night there like What She Likes. We think Tara's going to drown will do all of that I'll be really dramatic and cool which it was very dramatic and cool but it's like kills Jon connington in the books or something like that and they just weren't willing to do that to Jorah so they were like they wanted to do it without the ramifications of it or something like that do you know what I mean and that until then you just went up with everyone knows I'm very happy that you're is alive and well and wearing new clothing like course I am very happy but like if there is no further like the reason Shereen had get greyscale we said that we could understand what grayscale was so that when Jorah had grayscale we would be ready for it like this is what we're talking about in terms of like Little Star guitar strings grayscale was a big part of her character and what made people more sympathetic to her that she'd already gone through this like a tragic series of events and almost died and then and to be then burned alive like mimics your character like extra tragic outside so hard was to Drummond to our heads with the rules of grayscale where she never even talk of the books and said they had these like conversations about Gracie Allen stuff like that so like that have purpose that that grayscale leads leads to Jorah greyscale but what is yours grayscale lead to nothing and unlet you know in like certain things like Jon Snow coming back from the dead I feel like they're don't like is Jorah a changed man I don't think so like Daenerys is treating him a little differently right after all this but you know she's at she's kindly or to him than she was before but like I don't know that it's changed or that much it does it just feels like a lot of nothing I could be wrong in the end maybe grayscale will be hugely important for what's going forward but it feels odd that all that happened 6 episodes of sharmaine and I feel like some of the season a lot of subplots of come back but there's also been kind of overarching absence of consequences for things like Grace Kelly and I like you just mention I completely forgot about the whole Jon Snow and like with their become liquid he come back different you know when you come back to your friend changed in some way hence like they're being some kind of function for John still coming back other than we don't want him to be dead right and that is not played out other than that we see his scars and they they played in few conversations with him and Danny and stuff but it is certainly has not seen that like affect his personality in any way I do think that's disappointment since I've you put the counterfactual in my head that was possible I do things his appointment that that hasn't played out another way to explain I was also it like a similar Dynamic is also with Aria and getting all her assassin skill tree like we we thought oh would this change her and somewhat like all that stuff she went through with the faces meant like what does changer in some way with a personality difference between Spirit any consequences from all the stuff that you did and it seems to be I think as you put it earlier this season already against a bunch of cool skills like that's really what I mean that's really kind of what these subplots are ending up as is nice things happen to these people you know they they got to live longer because of them and they get to do other things because of them but they're there's no real sense of like what the dramatic purposes of these events and there's a lot of potential there anyone grayscale we'll see if it pays off in a big way in season 8 but so far I'm not super opal let's move on to the next email from Alex Blaire from Austin Alex rates Into Cash Kings gmail.com about the night King we got a bunch of emails about the night King and speculating about like what their whole situation is Alex rates in here is my season 8 Theory I think we are going to find out of the night King is more than a mere White Walker and as such will require something stronger than Valerian steel or Dragon glass in order to be despatched my guess is it will be discovered when John goes for a killing blow with a Valyrian steel sword slash dragon glass dagger and the night King will catch the blade in his hand and possibly cause to shatter followed quickly by him killing whoever was wielding it unless it was John because plot armor I feel like with how often lightbringer has been brought up over the series and as or a high getting name-dropped that just a plain Jane Valyrian sword or a dragon Glass Tiger won't do the trick and the squad will have to adjust there's a hashtag Squad goals accordingly and maybe someone can have to die in the reforging of lightbringer maybe another dragon in order to bring down Westeros gold medal Jack John thrower from Alex remind us oh I do you know who was our highest like this chosen one right and it was charged under extreme circumstances like he had to plunge it into the heart of his beloved wife needs and he said in order to like temper and stuff like that so the other people who think that lightly there will be a little sore that either John or generis wheels and you know one of the other will have to plug it into the heart of the other in order to to make it or something like that that could happen I'm more inclined to think of the other things like that drogon is daenerys's lightbringer or something you know like something more metaphorical and less like a literal history repeating sort of thing but I do really like this idea that we think and maybe Jon Snow and his people think that they know how to kill the night King cuz they know how to kill White Walkers and that they will sort of engineer I plan to pull it off and then we'll find out that that shit doesn't work on that I can cuz there's a reason why he said and I like that the area light one of my favorite series is Ben that re I will try and probably failed you assassinate the night King she's got that Valyrian steel dagger she's got her assassin skill so maybe she'll try to eat like infiltrate something sneak up get close try to use a Valyrian steel dagger it will work on him and Aria dies I'm not ready for arya's death but I'm just saying like I think an assassination attempt is in her future and I probably an unsuccessful one because probably either Jon Daenerys gets to be the one to kill the night King so yeah I like that very good prediction you know thinking back on the season Joanna I think I don't know if this is a disappointment I don't think it's more like what one thing I would like more of is I'm very fascinated by like the Society of white walkers like what is there what is their endgame what do they want what is your plan you know you see them interact a little bit when the dude Javelin over to the guy who kills viserion and it's kind of cool cuz it like these people they know what he used to execute very little of that and it feels like if we got more of it it would make the conflict more interesting right as if like I can understand like a virus or something but just sweeping you know like maybe there's a zombie virus like 28 Days Later or something or David dad you know like it's a zombie virus or whatever and sweeping across and any it just is like it consumes everything that's fine like that's that's totally valid way of having a think that's not that's not what this is this is a they actually have a plan the kind executed there's like this like hierarchy and command lines going on and I just wish we knew more about what their whole endgame was and why they're doing what they're doing you know your thoughts I feel like we'll never know because they don't talk I feel like we're never I would love a bottle episode where it's just like a work just full of like then I can has his worker bees and like today so you know yeah but I'm thinking of the final season as like the war against the night King because we just don't know what he wants and other than discuss destruction of everything and that's frustrating so yeah there's a lot of theories that like actually the night King will be taken out of the game quite early in season 8 and then the rest of the season will deal with the human fall out from it who knows but that's one thing that I like I like the idea of this big battle against that I can actually being self I like episode 2 and then what did humans do after you know but yeah I agree that see how they work what they do what Their plan is that would be really fascinating and instead it feels like a combination of a villain who because they don't speak you don't have to give them any characterization and like this kind of big ominous Unstoppable force and it works for the most part I just like I think it would be more interesting if we got two more emails to read one comes in from Anika Khan from Melbourne Australia who writes in that wall John has played a few times at his emotions will get the better of him in battle Danny has shown is Steely Edge in the ability to push her emotions down until the situation is dealt with when he was there and I she quickly gets on with the business of rescue between well John charges off in another heroic but possibly ill-advised moment you want your leader to be less the motive and to put the team first always struggle with recognizing these qualities as good leadership in woman to me that message was Danny is the person you want making decisions In the Heat of battle so that email us response to the topic of mental a couple weeks now about Danny's reaction to this area and dying in battle in episode 6 and how couple episodes ago I said I did not think that reaction was super strong considering how close he was to these dragons lot of people wrote in and said how dare you David could criticize someone Grieves over the death of a loved one to which i a h I guess I should have said that but you're an equal rights in and just put Synovus pin on how that scene might be interpreted you know that it's there it's Danny being in control and not a reacting emotionally in a very difficult situation so do I buy this interpretation China I quite like it I mean we have seen this is the second time like the John's whole thing of like he won't get on the dragon and he's like you know I think what the show where does interpretation of that was that he is going to offend everyone off of the Dragon really I think he could have hopped on the dragon and they could have gotten away I really do think they could have happened another interpretation that I think the guys over on binge mode how did John just wants to die but the yeah they mean by John let his heart rule his you know when he got put all his men in more precarious situation by rushing into rescue wreck and then it's not necessarily like we don't want to fall term for that because like what would we where are little brother that you know we never had any screen time with but probably cared about but then you see someone like Sansa you know Sansa and Daenerys may be making more strategic decisions which is not something that were used to you know an answer see to maybe like maybe these women of Westeros are making these the Lester typically feminine choices that are actually better signs of leadership in these extreme circumstances so I don't know why I don't know if I want to get rid of a judgement call him better or worse but definitely a contrast between Daenerys and style and John's which is I think we're thinking about you definitely John Robinson I'm going to pull an audible and I we have one more email here to rebut there was an email that came in from earlier this year a few weeks ago season 7 episode 4 that I had always wanted to read on the podcast and I never got around to it but I wanted to share with you because it's one of the one of my favorite emails that reminds me of the final email ever going to be today this email comes in from Christopher from Seattle Washington my stomping grounds and talking about a season 7 episode 4 of the show and Christopher 18 quote my favorite moment in last episode was not the battle it was one of those it really gets me know what's up before I could do with this email I'll just say this is the episode where Arya returns to Winterfell season 7 episode 4 Christopher when I was calling code threw me out of the house by sending me for my home in the Caribbean to America to live with extended family and go to school and get my degree the cost of living being so much higher in the US than in a third world nation like Trinidad and Dina student there were hard years like a block of about 7 years of being broke I've been horribly home sick the whole time and I could not afford to go back home regularly to visit even after finishing school and things getting a little bit better relocating in migrating to the US can be intense thing getting a work visa and a green card is a years-long tenuous process and all your investment in the new land you're living in can disappear there was about 10 years before I was finished sound and settled it to go back home regularly I distinctly remember that feeling after about 11 years of being a broad and coming home and the place feeling different foreign in my own home there were new buildings most people I know you had also emigrated or busy with lies and family the faces of many people look unfamiliar and foreign in some way I couldn't quite place a my accent has totally changed so I know I didn't quite sound quite like a local it makes one feel alone because home isn't home but I brought isn't home so where is Home exactly I don't feel that now because I go home every 3 to 6 months now and I'm caught up but I won't forget that feeling and I know things will never be the same that's what I saw when RS7 to Winterfell outside on that wagon and looked around that one shot wear pants around and nothing is exactly the same everything's the same but somehow not some pieces are in different places others aren't and it took so much work to get back yet the Tramp and feeling has come with cabinets there's some catching up to do that really affected mean maybe that's not their intention but it's how I saw it animal comes from Christopher from Seattle Washington it was a really lovely moments in the in the episode and I thought Kristen was emailed you should really just like hit home exactly what that scene in that episode captured really well so okay and finally finally mail this one comes from Steven who writes in from Baytown Texas Steven wrightson I'm writing from Baytown Texas to town 30 miles outside of Houston I just want to say I will never forget the season finale of Game of Thrones for different different reasons than most basically I was watching with my stepdad in the living room while flood waters from Harvey wear outside of my house the water never kept inside thankfully I'm very thankful we have the power for us to watch the finale because it was definitely a short distraction from the devastation that was happening around me however during the episode I couldn't help but think I hope this heavy rain stops because we were literally 6 inches from having it inside the house the entire Houston region was going through I've included some pictures of always inside my house the blue SUV see is mine but it's nothing compared to seeing what other people have lost I want to say thank you for doing this podcast because just listening to it is also a break from what has happened I love the show and I love how you guys analyze it but like I said this season finale will always be a memory for me not because of its content but because of what my beloved City went to take care of you all God bless hashtag Houston strong so thanks for reading in Steven and we did our hearts to go out to all the people who are going through a challenges from Hurricane Harvey and of course if you're out there and you feel move to donate to a charity of your choice please do that because people need your help right now but I wanted to talk about this real quick for me is reminds me that we have spent a lot of time criticize me show give me the show hard time so it's something we love to do it something that our listeners most of our listeners enjoy us doing but ultimately what shows like Game of Thrones are is Solace for people from the challenges of the world and some people have immense challenges like Steven from Texas but other people have more shows like Game of Thrones allowed to escape into this world and for many for millions of people it's extremely Bible what did you want to take away from this email yeah I mean it just just the perspective that like we keep talking about this like fictional storm coming like winter is coming so dang and the fact that this this analogy just comes out of this big huge thing that happen in our country and that you know there are terrible things happening all around the world also as a record this like most of the West Coast is on fire. Most of a lot of a lot of crazy stuff happening sort of and then like another storm is coming our way, so I don't know I just felt like some good perspective and contextualizing and yeah like an appreciation for both the show this podcast and the community around it and the HBO series for providing us with you know I'm not a distraction like it is in like we shouldn't pay attention to what's going on but you know we need other things to focus on the airspeed velocity of a laden Raven traveling from the wall to Dragonstone like you know that then there's a lot of Charity right now by JJ Watt who is football player you know it's on the counter like a crowdfunding site called youcaring.com and the title is Houston flood Relief Fund so he go to youcaring.com backslash victims of hurricane Harvey last night 15053 or probably type in Houston flood Relief Fund or something like JJ Watts Texas relief for the link that this is the one that I've chosen to donate to his when are our other podcast Brothers It's just in the back of it it seems like a very concerted effort to get the money directly to the people rather than bog down in in some red tape and this is what I get for my thoughts are with the people kissing people larger Texas the people whose have to have had to evacuate due to fire in California and Washington and Oregon and the people bracing for a storm that's coming we're thinking about you all the time you're the Avalanche of emails we got that I just read through over the past like 48 Hours as you very very much touched me because you're very lucky to have this community and I'm going to miss you guys and tell everyone thanks for listening to kastking this year and making the show what it is thanks to all of our sponsors for making this season of the podcast possible I guess that's it we'll see you in 20 Nike missed connection me the secrets I'll give you a wolf got me like we haven't seen you for awhile can imagine lately it feels like a need you goes pretty much all the time chicken breed am I crazy who is the distance between us friend since I came back from being dead it's not true I need to know that I can never done zombie won't be half as fun without you are you watching
