227 TMD Polygon Puzzle  How Many Degrees Are In a Polygon 
hey math fans Jason Marshall math dude here with your weekly math easier we recently talked about why the three interior angles of a triangle must always add up to 180 degrees and at various points in the past we've noted that the quartet of 90 degree right angles in a square must mean that the interior angles of a square add up to 360 degrees but we've never talked about what happens when we toss more sides into the mix in other words we've never talked about how to figure out the total number of degrees in a pentagon or a hexagon or octagon or any other polygons for that matter and just as importantly we've never dealt with whether or not there's some clever way to figure all of this out without resorting to making measurements with a protractor until now that is because these are exactly the question will beabout today as we dive into a delectably delicious polygon Puzzler our big goal for today is to figure out exactly how the interior angles of polygons change at the number of sides in the shape increases as a super quick review of polygon is any shape made up of three or more connecting sides that you can draw on a flat sheet of paper for a more thorough look at the definition of a polygon check out the episode on that topic the angles formed in the interior of a polygon where pairs of sides intersect are called interior angles as noted earlier we've talked about using a clever trick to prove that a triangles interior angles always add up to 180 degrees and we've seen that the four right interior angles of a square or any rectangle must add up to 360 Degrees which might lead you to wonder what happens when the number of sides increases Beyondin other words what's the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon a hexagon and octagon or any other polygon let's start by taking a look at the five sided regular polygon meaning its sides and angles are all equally sized better known as a pentagon if you sketch a pentagon you'll immediately see that its interior angles are all greater than 90° so the first thing we can conclude is that the interior angles of a polygon get larger as the number of sides increases but the real question is by how much at this point I encourage you to stop for a minute and see if you can figure out how you might go about answering this question if you're having trouble getting started think about the fact that you can draw a diagonal line across a 360° Square to break it up into a pair of 180 degree triangles so with that in mind take a minute or two and see what you canup with any ideas yet isn't this fun okay ready for the answer hopefully you noticed that a five-sided regular pentagon can be broken up into three triangles to see this draw a line from the top corner of your Pentagon down to each of its opposing lower Corners once you draw this picture you'll see that a pentagon is indeed composed of three triangles and from that you should also see that a pentagon must contain 3 x 180 degrees or 540 degrees so what does summarize so far the interior angles of a three-sided triangle add up to 180 degrees those of a four-sided Square add up to 360 degrees and those of a 5-sided Pentagon add up to 540 degrees it looks like we keep adding 180 degrees for each additional side does this trend holdup isremove two polygons with more and more sides to see let's make the next logical leap and move from thinking about a 5-sided Pentagon to a six-sided hexagon again I encourage you to take a few minutes to think about what we've done so far and to see if you can puzzle out the total number of degrees contained in the interior angles of a hexagon so take a few minutes and see what you can find do you see the trick if not here's a hint you want to use the same general idea as before okay got it to answer this question draw yourself a lovely regular hexagon and then draw three lines from one of its Corners to the three opposing Corners when you do this you should see that a hexagon can be broken up into four triangles and therefore you should see that a hexagon must contain 4 x 180 degrees or a total of 720 degrees do you see a trendif you really wanted to you could continue this game for the seven sided heptagon the eight sided octagon and so on in fact you can do it for any and every polygon when you do that you'll find that an N sided polygon where in simply represent the number of sides in the polygon can be broken down into an - 2 triangles which means that the interior angles of an N sided polygon will always add up to the quantity and -2 x 180 degrees which is the answer to today's great polygon Puzzler okay that's all the math we have time for today for more fun with math please check out my book the math dudes quick-and-dirty guide to algebra it's perfect for you and all the math fans in your life and it's available wherever you like to buy books thanks in advance for your support also remember to become a fan of the math dude on facelook at facebook.com the math dude and on Twitter at twitter.com Jason Marshall until next time this is Jason Marshall with the math dudes quick and dirty tips to make math easier thanks for listening map fans
