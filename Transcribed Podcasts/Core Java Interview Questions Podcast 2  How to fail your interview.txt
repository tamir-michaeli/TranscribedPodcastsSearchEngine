Core Java Interview Questions Podcast 2  How to fail your interview
welcome to the core Java interview questions podcast helping you with all the tips and tricks to make sure you get the job at developer job of your dreams and now your host Sam okay cool welcome to the coach of interview questions podcast episode number to as always you can get all the show tonight so we're going to come today at core Java interview questions. Com podcast to now today I wanted to cover a little bit about ways to fail your interview so in the last episode of the podcast we discussed five top tips for you to kind of Exile and stand out and show how awesome you can be as a way of nailing your interview process but one of the more important sites I think for me is avoiding waste fail so does this concept in economics division which is simply that imagine you're going down the street on G you found a hundred poundsthat's cool and you be happy but imagine instead that you lost a hundred pounds the way the human psychology works means that you were going to be disproportionately annoyed at losing a hundred pounds relative to you if you'd found it on if I could ease of showed that lost his are twice as powerful as games not really we don't want to lose things and how does this work with regards to finding your into you over for me I think it's very very similar concept relative to doing awesome stuff to look good versus doing things that make you look not so good so the things that we were discussing last week but you not having your own personal project for example that's cool and I looks really good but if you do something bad in your interview which were going to cover today that is disproportionate going to affect your chances it's much easier to avoid doing bad things than to do good thingsso it's really important you try and take on some of the concepts of going to discuss today and to try and avoid them on a good thing I know everything you experience I've actually had candidates come on do these things and I want to help you to avoid them because they're not stuff generally that people do intentionally it's just false of habit and it's important that you're consciously aware that you shouldn't be doing these things so that you can work the right to find them so let's dig at 9 so some of these points so the first one for me it's it's all about psychologyit's about you turning up and being excited for the interview and wanting to be that and make a good impression it might sound like common sense but you will be flabbergasted at the amounts of candidates that I've been to you that if arrived and have been so bored and uninterested in the entire process and I just I have no idea sometimes why this company interview they want the job but they are not showing that with the way that I talkin to me all the way that they're acting so let me give you a simple example imagine you arrive at an interview and sorry I've come down to pick you up and I'll go to hi I'm some and then maybe you'll be the high on Fridaythat's how you say nothing more that means and I have to make the conversation I have it's late already like pulling teeth what I want to hear it is for me to go now I am Sam and you've got high and Fred like thank you so much for spending the time today you know I really excited a little bit nervous to be here instantly you know you're showing me your enthusiastic about it it gives somewhere for the conversation to lead it makes it easier again you going to be working with these people for potentially yes and so you even want to stop building that relationship in the moment you got that and so all the way through your interview. Because don't be shorts and argumentative you want to infuse your stick going to be really interested in the role I don't know it just sounds cheesy and it sounds painful but it's one of those things that can make a big difference because frankly interview is how he goes but we know that you're interviewing with other places not fine we want to know that you love I will roll that youcare about others and do you want to impress us you have to Panda to that ego as sad as it sounds so when you go just very consciously make sure you're monitoring your attitude you're monitoring your body language in the way the impression that you are giving out this is just it's usually point it's the most important thing you know if you coming you are straight away your bouncy and you clearly care about the role or you know you told me that you're you're nervous and you know we have a conversation about that I'm already on your side and that's exactly what you want me to beI'm kind of like as an extension of this is well this by Cito don't talk over the interview at we had come to us before they will insist on trying to have a discussion but I will just typed okay with you and they will interrupt you and that makes me thinks that if I'm going to what would you in the future you're going to do that to me then as well and I don't know where that guy I want to have a conversation that you have to directions so don't be polite be enthusiastic and it will make a big difference do not go grumpy even if you are grumpy even if you're tired don't show it so importantmeeting to study different time so this is one of my biggest bug bites is people trying to Guess answers Jehovah is huge there's so much you know landscape to ask about and frankly, know everything nobody knows everything and that's okay we are built to not want to say to interview I don't know you want to give that impression that you know everything but the simple fact is that you don't and that's okay if you go to an interview and someone asks you a question and you don't know and you try and guess you trying when your way through it it's not going to work they're asking the question because they know the answer to it already they know what they're doing and if you're trying to catch you just going to look stupid because they know that you're guessing but you're not able to admit to them that you don't know so next time when you're headed to you if you don't know the answer to a question say I'm sorry I don't know that one not totally fine like ever see you hoping that that's not going to be for every question but in reality you going to be okay if my semen if you have one or two that you don't know tell them that you don't know but then followed that up with saying oh but I can have a guest if you like or I can try and work through it often with these questions it's not so much testing that you already have the pre-existing knowledge is required but it's testing your analytical skills are you able to view from first principles figure something out and this comes out his gun to something we discussed before which is about it being a conversation this isn't a One Direction of the interview is being questions at you and you are answering but it's a discussion so what could be the problem ask question say oh I think it's this what do you think just whatever you do don't try and guess that is that is my point and I think one of the the big areas around this that caused it to happen is people lying on the CVS do not lie on your CV please please don't lie on your CV cuz you will you will get call out one of the things that seems to happen a lot these days people like to put a list of Technologies on my CV and so you got the CDs which you have such engine bay why you have 40 50 different Technologies listed and sometimes kind of doesn't know I am out of town at this so I miss 6 out of 10 if you put a technology on your CV I have the right to ask you about it and Grill it and you don't know what my area specialty is so you might put something on that you used 5 years ago for 10 minutes ago now you know that makes me feel really good if I grill you on that and you don't know it you going to look really she fit and this is why the the lying part comes in. I know what will happen imma see if you have got to say it's ready but if you put it on that and then say oh I don't know why that some of that because you know I know that you're trying to look better video CV make it pure make it clean for the technologies that your profession in and that you'll come from in and then you want me to lie it's also better from my perspective cuz I know what your specialty is course you can use 40 or 50 different things with technologist we use lots of libraries we try a different languages but in reality you only use one or two maybe three regular day today that's what I care about that's what I'm high when you fall probably concentrate on those ones make your CV Focus around the things that you're really good at if I care about I don't even know what state I will ask you about it that's okay the next one. Let's talk about is in terms of interview technique and candidates you keep talkin and talkin and talkin and they don't stop talking and I will continue coming on about an unsafe around and ever and ever and ever and ever just happens a lot particular joining phone into these her phone so you know maybe I'll ask a question about what do you think about a particular framework I'm done I'm treated to 20 minutes of someone explaining to you need all the intricate details and all the parts of it and it's that's it that's a long time to be talking to me not shows that you are incapable of describing and explaining things in a concise money being concern he's a huge the important part of being a developer program you know when you got together as a group this is why design patterns exist as a way of you having up to explain complete how you are designing something go do something when you get together in a group you want to be able to discuss things quickly and thoroughly if it takes you 20 minutes to explain a topic which I think most people could say explain in two or three you're clearly showing that you know that's a weak spot for you it's also really hard to keep talkin and talkin like I think it's just it's a nervous habit you know people when they get nervous they want to fill the guy and they want to keep going that's hot that a lot of information you're having to rock your brains and there's a big chance that you'll get something wrong the less you say the importance of what you're saying will be correct or will be valuable so try when you're answering questions to keep it down to say a minute or two minutes mean it will depend quite strongly on whatever it is you're answering but just do your very very best to keep it short and if you find that you want to keep talkin bee game for a while stop and say to the person interviewing you is it okay if I stop there or would you like me to go on cuz you know you're not coming what I want yet keep going and which way is fine or there will be stuff left to cover in which case you giving him not in road to say I will see you. You had cuz if you keep talkin mess and cheese we just to let you keep talking if you're not going to look right as a result of that so I know one more thing and I really this is the biggest thing for me this is the entire reason that I've started. Started call Java interview questions. Com is that interviewed so many candidates that have not bothered to prepare I'm sending you this is baffling if I know I'm going to go for them to eat I'm going to spend some time to deliver on the internet looking for interview questions that I might get us to refresh my cell phone call subjects the simple fact is the interview that you're going to do is going to bed relatively little resemblance to what you do when your day job you know your day job is actually programming code it is structuring things its design and you know you have an ID to code completion for you and that's great but then you guys means of you and you're going to get questions about okay how do you implement a legless if you know if you have to build yourself what's the difference in a regular smell like a regular sauna linked list how does the threading mother working Java can you talk to me about garbage collection this is stuff that we don't let you know what day today what we generally don't do it you're going to get interviewed on the niche stuff on the corner case the edge case and you need to practice for that you know it's coming but if you've done any interviews before you know the sort of questions are going to come and I found more often than not it's done about that they just turn up and then they completely Funk on the questions this is great for you because you're already a step ahead of the game you're listening to this podcast you been to the website that means that you actively know you need to prepare for an interview that puts you ahead of most kind of that sound by please though just this isn't it something you need to continuously do it again like yoga lie about a kind of it at this but this is stuff that you cover a couple days before the interview if you're always checking back in a few things trying to get as much stuff in your head as you possibly can basically so keep providing things spend you know if you've got a lot of interviews coming up you should be spending 20 30 minutes day maybe an hour practicing coating practicing at into the site interview questions but looking around looking on the website hopefully for everything that you can to try and cram it into your brain things like holding the great for the best because you can code stuff that you don't normally do I just lay around like Freddy models in the jvm that makes it stick better because you will inevitably got questions why you asked to remember API he's like no tell me about the various methods on thread and no one can remember that stuff but if you've written some sort of exercise at home you're much more likely to remember it so practice coding read up and read upon interview technique you've got one hour and only to impress some people and if you have spend the time before to practice the real and stuff you're going to look much much better and you got the very last chance of nailing your interview so hopefully is of used to you know what covered of a number of things that I of ways that you can file your interview and most possibly want to do so that you won't fail your interview if you have any other suggestions or tips put them in the comments that again it said call Java interview questions.
