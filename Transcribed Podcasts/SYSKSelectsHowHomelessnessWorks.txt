He's the best I've even posted some pretty good stuff too but like with with some what's one of your favorite things that have gotten people buzzing lately did I post about Bonnie Prince Billy was out of my own Facebook page I don't know yeah did you now cuz you would have taken it down I would not have I would respect your post I'm sleepy today because of Bonnie Prince Billy last night I would scoff at it but I wouldn't take it then I love this become a running gag is me loving him and making fun of him good okay you ready for me to make fun of him he seems like a nice guy hey brother blog post actually recently on homelessness I read it did you read it really a fan yes really so the whole thing then you know this already was centered around while it started around the some this news that came out in July that the homeless the population of homeless school children and dramatically to about 1 million kids in US schools public schools I would imagine who are homeless right and in one particular area I think by the number statistically speaking in Sioux Falls South Dakota yeah that's a homeless kid per classroom yeah they had a huge increase didn't they there. Old school district it's jumped 44% over the last 5 years and it wouldn't Texas like a hundred plus percent yeah so across the across the u.s. there's been an increase of 41% nation wide right at the school children yes of homeless school children and so Texas has seen an increase of 139% Iowa 136 % the lowest of the highest V is New Jersey with an 84% increase and this is of course I'll do to the Great Recession sure that's going on right now right of course and somebody actually posted I haven't read the links but somebody actually posted a comment on the blog that said you know it's bad enough you know homeless cultural children are depressing enough but you know if there's plenty of homeless kids out there who are in school well yeah sure that so with the economic recession clearly to blame for this 41% increase in homeless school children and there's a lot of other factors that over the hours of contributed to homelessness which will talk about the Chuck let's talk about homelessness in the United States shall we and we should say we're just going to concentrate in the United States actually I've got a few stats do you have well just some stats okay so let's go ahead and talk about this and get the around the world out of the way worldwide they they approximate and we should go ahead and say that County homeless people is is a tough bag because it changes drastically week-to-week sometimes we should say that it's called the point in time count where is basically like all right everybody go count the homeless people in your area today on this one particular night and then reported in and then will tally the number and then the other way to do it is basically over a year and that's like a huge undertaking usually done by the Census Bureau that identify you know how many people have used homeless shelters how many of them have been different and ignorant up with a pretty rough number well yeah but one of the reasons it's it's difficult is because fortunes change rapidly in this crazy fast moving world and homeless people sometimes are in cars and campgrounds in places where you can't find them so it's tough to get the dead accurate numbers but having said all that my friend I do have some stats worldwide approximately 100 people around the world are homeless hundred million people in the world end of the year and it says there's about 30 million displaced indigenous people I don't know if they count that is homeless necessarily I would imagine so that might be part of that larger number and then I started thinking about but other homeless everywhere and of course there are but I said what about places like Sweden and Norway like where you not expect homeless people they have them there but sweet and only has about 17,000 homeless out of 9.3 million people just a small percentage Norway though has one point for homeless people for every 1,000 people which is why it's not too far off America's percentage really cuz we have about 1% right to about 3 to 3.5 million people is the latest number I saw the latest number I saw was actually less than that what was it doesn't make sense because it's it's to the homeless population has increased right right in the US since the recession yes so 2005 number I think was 2.3 and 3.5 million between those two right like at you like you just said but then there's another one from 2009 it's a 1.56 to the numbers are all over the place I'm at the snow right yeah so that's a little bit from around the world Russia China Africa Canada it happens everywhere most of this is US base because that's where we are what we can say though is that percentage wise there's a disproportionate number of minorities is there homeless and minorities in this country make up about 12% of the population in African Americans make up about 50% and another 13% are Hispanic right homeless in the United States African-Americans are they account for between 38 and 50% of the homeless population right but they only make up about 12% of the US population this is obviously go see most of this in big cities but it's a problem in rural areas it well as well as well as well homeless families make up a greater proportion of the homeless in yeah we're all areas which is that's any kind of homelessness is sad but an entire family being homeless is it that's really tough check we talked about what was driving homelessness right now driving the increase is the recession but in the late 20th century as well 20 actors in the two biggest drivers are poverty and increase in poverty and a decrease in the availability of affordable housing huge factors in addition to others that will talk about later that have contributed to people not having a home status that it will talk about all the other factors like drugs and alcohol and mental health and stuff like that but it's sad that the reason why people I found some steak can't afford housing right and here's here's something I just want to put this out there now I was reading a history of homelessness in the US and that the author was basically saying homeless has been around forever like apparently 14th century England had vagrancy laws people have been homeless have been not necessarily living on the streets but don't have a permanent residence and that's an important point to when we talk about homelessness we're not just talking about people sleeping on the street we're not just talking about people sleeping in Emergency Shelters or even in their cars the true genuine definition of homelessness is you don't have a home right you don't have a place that you were own you're staying with family you live in a weekly motel that that's homeless as well right back to the the history of homelessness the author was saying you know we've had homeless in the US since we've been here the difference is we used to have homeless because we couldn't afford to give them work right right afford to take care of them right now we can't afford to take care of him we just don't write you know well yeah that's interesting you brought that up because I was reading about other countries in America seems to be unique and a very bad way and that a lot of Americans feel like it's deserve and because you messed up by doing something really bad or you're on alcohol or drugs and homeless people deserve to be home most most of the rest of Americans just don't think about it at all and just was very invisible problem right there are people that do care and don't think they deserve it and they're good people or Advocates

that stamps.com enter stuff how do people get home with Josh will check let's talk about it we do we said that poverty and lack of affordable housing or to the biggest drivers with with poverty right now when you when you quantify poverty and the poverty line you basically figure out how much the average person pays in a stator in a nation or so I think that for housing utilities food that kind of thing then you said a line and say anything below this is your eligible for government assistance right right you're poverty-stricken in the US the poverty line is somewhere around 17 grand a year for a family of three write the problem is there's a big disparity between the poverty line and the minimum wage so the federal minimum wage is $10.25 an hour for a person to work 40 hours a week it's a normal Work Week 52 weeks a year navigation like they work 5 days a week every week they were gross $15,080 that's not very much money right so you're actually falling below the poverty line making the the federal minimum wage right and then consider that actually to afford a two-bedroom apartment this is the median for the cross the states to afford to two-bedroom apartment at 30% of your income which is the definition of affordable housing at 7 to making 725 an hour you worked 87 hours a week ridiculous so there's a big part of the problem right there where you at it said one of the stats in here that was shocking was about 15% of homeless people actually have jobs so I saw 44% actually I really not in this article but in it I've just across the internet first what what is clear is that a lot of people end up homeless that don't think they would ever end up homeless they live paycheck to paycheck to have a job in there getting by but then something happens either lose a job or they have some outrageous medical bills or some catastrophe happens and then your average Joe or Jane with a job can find themselves homeless like pretty easily sometimes it's not always just some schizophrenic who has a heroin problem you know right in fact most of the time I say it's not we also talked about the lack of affordable housing right we said the definition of affordable housing is 30% of your income right apparently there are five million temperature shooting for ya yeah 5 million us households pay more than half of their income in rent that is unbelievable it's called worst case scenario and the rule of thumb is if you pick order your doing good I really yeah yeah so yeah half of your income in rent you're in a bad bad way to be living in whatever big city or living in well that also encompasses that worst case scenario also encompasses people who live in substandard housing as well so it's not just how much you're paying out it's what you're paying for or combination of the two right I'm part of the problem Chuck to your memory Techwood housing housing damals remember they demolished Ecuador dance like the projects in Atlanta right before the Olympics they're just gone and it was like okay all you poor people you don't have to go home cuz you don't have one anymore but can stay here and that was that and apparently there's a that was a nationwide Trend since the 80s between 80 and 2003 more than 2 million low rent housing units were basically they're demolished or turned into you know high-rise expensive high-rises and during that same period from 82 to 2003 government assistance for housing go by half decreased by half so that's going to go a lot of homeless so it's not and not only do we not helping the homeless we actually creating on this so we talked about obviously pay and being down on your luck temporarily living paycheck-to-paycheck why else would you come home kind of hit the nail on the head a little bit when you talked about heroin-addicted skitzofrenix those can be a combination of those two or separately mental illness and addiction or two big short actors in homelessness is with the mentally ill apparently it's about 20 to 25% of all homeless people have some type of mental illness that brings up a really interesting point have you ever heard the urban legend that Ronald Reagan is responsible for the increase in homelessness because he close down all of the mental institutions yes I have heard that that's actually not too far off the Mark when he was governor of California from like 67 to 74 he shut down a lot of the state-run psychiatric hospital so really when he became president one of the major things he cut funding to was the treatment of mental illness and because of this cut in funding a lot of mental hospital shut down in a lot of mentally ill people found themselves homeless so kind of indirectly in that sense he he definitely contributed to an increase in homelessness well should we go and talk about the McKinley vento act then Reagan it has says only significant homeless act of Congress are the McKinley mckinney-vento act that was a different name but then they named it after Stewart McKinney and Bruce vento to her to the biggest Champions all sorts of cool programs in a shelter transitional housing Healthcare food job training substance abuse Services all kinds of cool stuff and it's really ironic that he was the president that sign that in the law because he is also why the credit in the sky took off so many republican Listen Earth he is widely credited as creating the homeless problem in the u.s. not just through deinstitutionalization but through the creation of the wealth Gap that rhyme scene between 1980 and now you talk about substance abuse and about two-thirds of homeless people struggle with some kind of alcohol or drug problem not surprisingly and then sadly domestic violence has a big part to do with their special with women about half the women are battered women and they often times don't have anywhere to go either if if they're brave enough to actually flee their jerk husband abusive husband then there they have nowhere to because their husband might be the sole Breadwinner sure and in that kind of circumstance so they have battered women shelters thank God for just for women that suffer from abuse Chuck kids to take half of a runaway homeless runaways were fleeing domestic abuse or homeless kids on their own I guess we're playing domestic abuse in about 20% were fleeing sexual abuse it doesn't stop there unfortunately when you are homeless on the street you encounter even more abuse many times you leave home to leave an abusive situation at home you live on the street when you get attacked on the street for being homeless or you are forced into doing really bad things for the food and shelter and stuff like that untoward things at the bus station at the bus station and Veterans Josh are a big part of our homeless problem in that I can't see status of all cuz it's all really sad but when you're veterans when he could fight for this country and you end up one of the 200,000 homeless single man usually with mental illness substance abuse problems because of maybe post-traumatic stress disorder that is heartbreaking you just keep getting that there's a lot of overlap and problems or factors of in homelessness like you know veterans may be homeless veterans may be more prone to having a substance abuse problem or suffering from a mental illness like PTSD or Substance Abuse and Mental Illness overlap and other people as well and part of the problem is you get to get into a vicious cycle use their far few Services if you were services available easily accessible on the street then there are if you have a house and then come in and address and phone number and all the normal stuff that that you just kind of need to be able to get by in the US these days and you know you you look at something like the Department of Veterans Affairs which does is get a job as they can so I know but they can only accommodate about 25% of homeless veterans that was so frustrating isn't it accommodate all of them if they wanted to say hey. Do you want to do the funding record bonuses for CEOs on one hand and then you hear about homeless veterans the money is out there and I'm glad it was Veterans that got you I hope it's homeless school children it's somebody else I have somebody hears Us in in realizes that we have all the money we need to get the papers everybody sure it's just some of the wealthiest are going to have to give up a little bit of it some of the poorest have a house it's as simple as that we have the means is that the will yeah we're not talking about just some social program at these alcoholics living off my dime were talking about homeless veterans in children and Abused Women and even if it is alcoholic veterans we've already have we not learned already that alcoholism in all addiction is a brain disease that follows the brain disease model these days you need treatment well that's a whole stupid American idea that talked about was it some people feel like they deserve to be homeless I see him on the street and they think what did you do to get here instead of what can I do to help you with this touched a nerve today it's almost there well really should talk about some of the effects of these you can file injured but it Bears saying what you were talking about women shelters for women shelters only linen women and if you have a teenage son so you can kiss him goodbye so bye bye family unit physical attacks how most people are attacked and beaten kicked change numbers that are related spray paint is pretty bad just because they're homeless people will go out and beat up homeless people well there's like a whole line of thinking that like serial killers practice on Drifters or chair hey everybody since you like stuff you should know we're placing a pretty good bet that you love another podcast here on the stuff Network up and vanished and it's up for its second season and you're going to love it it's right it's produced by Tenderfoot TV right here in Atlanta with our pals up and vanished they merge storytelling and investigation highlighting a new missing persons case each season and bringing you inside deep inside the Investigation season they took up a cold case for Tara grinstead is a former teacher and in pageant Queen from here in Georgia who went missing at as a result the show led to a confession to rest in the pending trial now they're on season 2 and they're taking up another case of Crystal and Risinger how about that Crystal and Risinger moved to crestone Colorado to pursue our spiritual path the missing since 2016 so pain in the gang or getting involved they're going to investigate further tracing crystals journey and asking for answers yep I've been better season 2 is available right now and for free on Apple podcast I join the conversation that up and vanished. Com health effects for kids if your homeless you can have a higher rate of stomach problems asthma ear infections depression anxiousness is pretty prevalent now it's a cause of Aang is caused by homelessness and not just adults but kids as well like you can actually start to develop PTSD because you don't know where you're going to sleep the next night at my I mean think about it Chuck like have you ever been without a home like I would think it can be really weird to not know where you going to stay or did not just you know have a hard day at work or hard day at school and to go to know that at the end of this day you have no idea where you going to sleep babe I'm going to sleep in your car maybe going to sleep in the woods but you don't get to just rest you don't get to just take a shower and bright beer and watch you no TV or whatever it takes to unwind your stress level is heightened constantly without any resolution to it and of course you're going to suffer PTSD or at least stomach ache something bad adults too it's not just kids they can get frostbite leg ulcers respiratory infections HIV and AIDS and diabetes more common way more common than the homeless population tell lots of health effects going on Josh I agree Chuck to check we talked about Reagan as both Creator and alleviator of homelessness you talked about some of the programs that the mckinney-vento Act created some of the other programs that have been developed in the United States are like Section 8 housing do you know about this let's well that there's there's homeless shelters which are like the emergency beds when it's cold that kind of thing we can go temporarily right now a lot of those are I would say most I don't have any numbers on this but I would say most of those are privately operated. Really yeah and then there is the Section 8 thing that you were talking about which is not public housing it's when you fill out of Section 8 voucher and you can go find just a regular private apartment to rent from a landlord Scott to fit certain require and if you meet all those requirements you only have to pay 30% of the rent and bills government pays the other seven straight to the landlord so that section 8 section 8 in another huge waiting list a lot of cities of shut it down until the list gets smaller and they're like there's no point in keeping a list of 4 years 5 years was going to shut it down get the list, and then open it back up in a couple years so good luck getting section if that's what you're trying to do and you talked about did you mention public housing so what you talked about shelters apparently there were five hundred thousand beds in 2005 is now $643,000 there were there wasn't 2009 in about 3 million to 3.5 million homeless people yeah but that's a pretty significant increase in 5 years but with public housing if if Section 8 is not an option there is public housing were there used to be at least into at Techwood which is basically like an apartment block at where you go and live and you pay what you can and as long as you follow the rules I just made are quotes you can stay there as long as you like right again there's not that many public housing units are not as many as there used to be we need to talk about food banks cuz that's a big part of being homeless is getting your meal and you know the United States is not like starvation in other countries where there is no food there's lots of food here lots of food is thrown away so since the 1960s do you know that there is an estimate that up to half of the food we produce is thrown away in the u.s. in the low estimate is a quarter wow I tell you I never go get a job in the film industry if you wanted food waste depresses you just catering the whole thing you know it's ridiculous but everyone knows you can donate canned goods and non-perishable items and they will distribute them to homeless shelters in in homeless people directly sometimes such a big deal before this makes me want to do more than that yeah that feels like going to church on Easter you know we should do we should build like in addition on your house that we can house homeless people in we can go to squat Ville we can put up a lean-to or something else not a bad idea job training though I mean we talk about things like public housing in the projects and that's all well and good to get people place to be but at the same time you don't and this is where they're probably going to say it at the same time you don't want to support a nation of people on the government's time without offering some kind of job training and something to say hey let us help you get on your feet let us help you get a job in data entry or on the manufacturing line or whatever so low play there are groups like The Coalition for the homeless First Step that that you know provide this kind of job job training and the veterans are doing the same thing with the homeless veterans reintegration program and I should say there isn't a homeless alleviation program in existence in the US that's geared towards simply taking care of people that really all of them are geared toward ending homelessness in the end of rifle and collectively through things like job training right through things like helping to write resume yeah rehab rehabs a huge one a mental health treatment getting people cheap drugs like getting them to a point where they're not homeless anymore like it's addressing the factors of homelessness not he don't feel like working so here's some money right that doesn't exist right and I suspect that there's not really a desire to just have somebody give some money and not do anything ever and just be poor it in anybody it's mine it's my opinion we disagree that's awesome well I don't know if I disagree not enough time to think about that right now what can you do though well you can we can build lean-to Zone you're squatting land you can volunteer like you said right give your time if you don't have the dough whole time if you do have the dough and it's really just do you can donate old toys and books and toiletries and clothes that old computer that's Gathering dust that you could get $75 for on Craigslist to donate that instead write it off on your taxes and maybe how much people can get trained how to use a computer or you could donate your car be an advocate try to raise awareness letter campaigns all sorts of things you can do there you can hire homeless people yes it's they do have skills as we've seen a lot of people who are recently unemployed recently homeless may also just be recently unemployed as well and have job skills and then the last on the list in the article which I thought was a great respect huge when you see that homeless person on the street don't let the first thought to be in your head hey Jerk how did you mess up to get here maybe you should think hey did you develop schizophrenia in your thirties and lose your job because of that and get split up from your child because you can care for your child even though you you know you want to is it going to happen to Will Smith I was hoping we can make it through this without bringing up that stupid movie The Pursuit of Happiness yeah well it's they make a movie about it it was such a big deal everyone knows it. That guy was homeless with a sun and moon box actually you know what story I like better it's the one in this article that was a guy what was named David yeah he said he's quoted David Pirtle yeah he was in that respect he he was a just a regular dude had a job as a restaurant manager college graduate and for 15 years as a restaurant manager and develop schizophrenia got fired ended up hitchhiking and homeless for two years on the streets of DC and now I think he is heading up a homeless group in DC now and yeah but he's quoted in this article in the respect like what can you do he says most of the Despair and being homeless comes from being treated like you don't exist right and there's something we should point out check throughout this it's however many minutes into this podcast nah we just now used the first homeless person's name first and last name of the whole podcast there's a whole conception of invisibility the nameless they are not the nameless you can completely interchange that with the homeless that's just as faceless just as namelessness is genderless just as identity list and I just want to close and get everybody to go over to on design there's this awesome blog post by a guy named John that Kara Thacker a called look or connect and he's talking about he's using photography to demonstrate how we treat the homeless and how we should treat the homeless and there's a Photography book called shelter and this guy roamed around Europe and took photos of homeless like impromptu makeshift shelters like blankets hanging over a lemon in a in the woods or Express lease under an overpass but in every single picture it's just the shelter not one homeless person appears in this whole book interesting and the kicker is pointing out like this is kind of emblematic of how we view the homeless right and then he was also kind of crediting a girl named Erica Schultz who is a photographer out of Seattle and she has a series called invisible families and she'll she photographs the homeless but then the caption should include captions beneath the the photograph and it's of that person so there's one of a little kid walking through a homeless camp and he's he's got like this bamboo stick up Sam and the caption is hear Jack Ahern age 9 marches with the bamboo stick while staying at a city located in Skyway sometimes Jackman in Les fellow Nickelodeon's it's and quotes to help him look for worms on other days he play on a pogo stick in mud puddles or with the resident Can kitten that had six digits on one paw the bamboo stick was a gift why I like that's a person now homeless kid it's Jack Ahern age 9 well and then the villain from DC suggest that if you have a regular walk to work in the city or something where you see the same homeless person on a daily basis then ask him what their name is one day call him by their name look him in the eye if you don't have to give him money if you don't want to little things like that can make a big difference in a person's self-esteem and maybe allows them to view themselves as human again and you can give them if you're worried about giving the money that they spend on alcohol or something give them get him to get a little food gift voucher you know something like that so there is everybody I V summation of the podcast Fifth and final yes do you want to learn more about homelessness you can type that word into the search bar at how stuff works the blank generic genderless identity list search bar.
