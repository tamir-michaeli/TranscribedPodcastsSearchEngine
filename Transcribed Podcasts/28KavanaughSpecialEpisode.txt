28KavanaughSpecialEpisode
I'm in the city with Elizabeth Joe and we're recording this on Tuesday October 2nd at 2:13 p.m. Pacific Coast time and this is a special choke on law about the cabin on confirmation process because it's just the thing that's on the Forefront of everyone's mind on our minds been in a state of confusion so a little recap remember that on September 27th there was a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee either they're already had been hearings with Brett Kavanaugh in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee this was a special one and part prompted by allegations by Christy and blasi Ford that she had been sexually assaulted by Brad Kavanagh when they were both high school students in the 1980s this particular day of both on Christine blasi for who testified alone and then more testimony from Judge Capital responding to these allegationsshow Ford spoke at length about what she recalled from her experience of having been sexually assaulted and there were many moments many very emotional moments in her testimony and one struck me in particular raster and many people are focused today on what you're not able to remember about that night I actually think you remember a lot I'm going to phrase it a little differently can you tell us what you don't forget about that night and Ford responded the stairwell the living the bedroom the bad on the right side of the room as you walk into the room there was a bed to the right the bathroom and close proximitythe laughter the aporias laughter and the multiple attempts to escape and the final ability to do so and then it was Cavanaugh's turn Judge Kevin I had released a statement prior to his testimony but it was clear that when it came up to the actual day and his turn before the committee he departed pretty radically from what he had planned to say and said he'd offered this really angry partisan and sometimes tearful response to these allegations by dr. Ford Judiciary Committee eventually after hearing from both of them decided to have a vote and they did vote on party lines to send his nomination out of committee that so it's basically a procedural mechanism to get his nomination before the entire Senate first the incentives job to provide advice and consent the one twist here was that Senator flake announced that he was providing his critical vote on the condition that there was some understanding of there being a ditional limited investigation into the sexual assault allegations So currently the FBI is conducting a further background investigation on September 29th President Trump tweeted just started tonight our 7th FBI investigation of Judge Brad Kavanagh he will someday be recognized as a truly great Justice of the United States Supreme Court and over the weekend after claims or questions at least that there were some limits maybe the Moors I'm going to be an entirely of thorough investigation Trump then tweeted on September 30th wow just starting to hear the Democrats who are only thinking obstruct And Delay are starting to put out the word at the time and scope of FBI looking into judge Cavanaugh and Witnesses is not enough hello for them it will never be enough stay tuned and watch so right now it's not clear what's going to happen there are some claims that there may be more facts out there that need to be covered it's not clear what the FBI is looking into one of the sister of speculation a leaking Senate leader Mitch McConnell has announced to the W vote very soon as soon as the end of the week so that's what gives us an opportunity to think about well what are some issues that we can think about right now I want to talk about those issues right now after this are you moaning for a time when politics was about something and made sense I recommend revisiting the Bartlett Administration with the West Wing weekly that fictional president had a Nobel prize in economics what a thought about you that kind of thing The West Wing weekly is a great podcast about so much more in the TV show The West Wing find it at radiotopia. FM or wherever you get Podcast the first kind of mundane things to consider in all this is that the new Supreme Court term has actually started season begins on the first Monday of every October which was yesterday for us and right now there are only eight justices course because the judge Kevin. Has been nominated to fill that vacant seat so there's not a nice dresses they're there may be one soon we don't know but what happens in the meantime they have to decide their cases well if there are five justices who can come to an agreement on a legal issue then the Supreme Court to reach a decision right but what if they can't so that sometimes happens and there's we've experienced this before so pretty recently when Justice Scalia died in 2016 there were eight justices on the court then there's a little bit of a difference though because at that time there was one justice justice Kennedy who sometimes been referred to as a swing on the court he would sometimes join with some more liberal members of the court and sometimes not so there was some chance that there might be some variability in the decisions but if you get a straight kind of idiot logical vote you're going to have a 4-4 split on a court so it's illegal effective that that means that you know all of the cases are coming for the the Supreme Court or at least the vast majority of them come from a different court right so that means that the lower court decision to stand it just that did just comes but it just stays a lot it was and that's okay sometimes but there may be really pressing super important issues and generally the Supreme Court tends to review things that are very important to the nation in terms of how to resolve a legal problem in the system and boy that's her to look tough when you have a bunch of cases where the Supreme Court Justices can I come to a decision so that's one to the Practical thing cases the delayed or will they just go through with eight just says no matter what no matter what and so you'll get language sometimes that if there is a 4-4 split I'll just be a decision by the court that says something like the judgement is affirmed by an equally divided court so that sort of like we couldn't decide so the lower court decision just and so does alter the mechanics of a cord and if he becomes the 9th but he can sort of talk himself on two pieces are already arguing can a case that was submitted to the Supreme Court where the Lord willing stands because it's a for Fort I cannot ever be resubmitted the Supreme Court a similar issue could come up before the court again there's another issue to write in that that's been kind of popular on social media right now and well what about impeaching Judge Kavanagh Kavanagh of course he could be theoretically impeached because the impeachment Clause of the Constitution has been interpreted to apply to federal judges but then there's the Practical part which it is you know impeaching a federal judge is as hard as impeaching a president it takes a simple majority of the house to get the process going but to actually remove a federal judge you need a two-thirds of Senate vote to remove that person makeup of the center right now it seems highly unlikely is it possible that he could be impeached even if you just returns to his current regular job on the DC federal court of appeals he could but again the same impeachment problem you have to have a kind of supermajority Buy but it seems pretty unlikely that he be impeached there's a lot of information misinformation out there right now if no suggesting the judge Merrick Garland who was nominated by President Obama but just nomination was never even considered by the Senate that he could somehow impeach judges judge Cavanaugh that's not the way it works 50 senators and then with the vote of pants making 51 approve of Judge Cavanaugh to become just as Kavanagh and the how do you somehow get 2/3 of the Senate to impeach him that just seems the math to says where can I go about their choice to vote for him but I don't get that impression I think that's right so there's like a symbolic appeal form to a lot of people about impeachment but practically highly unlikely an image of third thing that as being raised just by the testimony alone that Judge Kevin are gave last week and so let me return to a little bit of what he said he addressed specifically the Democratic senators on the Judiciary Committee here's what he said he said you are words have meaning you sold the win for decades to come I fear that the whole country will reap the Whirlwind the behavior of several of the democratic members of this committee am I hearing a few weeks ago was an embarrassment but at least it was just a good old fashion attempt at working this whole to wake effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit fueled with a parent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record revenge on behalf of the clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left wing opposition groups to this is striking for a lot of reasons why it's very partisan highly unusual it just can't emphasize that enough for a sitting federal judge to say something like this he's quite angry at that point but there's a serious issue here to write so keep in mind what Kevin I said at at that hearing and that was he is attacking members of the Judiciary Committee Democratic senators so Senator Richard Blumenthal is a member of the committee it's also the case that he is the named plaintiff and one of the emoluments show in a lawsuit called Blumenthal versus Trump this is a lawsuit by a number of members of Congress that says that Trump is violating the foreign emoluments Clause by continuing to receive profits from his private businesses when foreign governments stay at his hotels are uses golf courses are one. Still on going but we don't we don't know the resolution of it but importantly the day after the Ford and Cavanaugh hearing a federal judge ruled that the plaintiffs in that emoluments Clause case has standing in other words they had the kind of legal injury that occurred could see erratically your address at the end point of this lawsuit so that means the case doesn't get dismissed right now okay so imagine this lawsuit eventually making its way up to the Supreme Court it could be a variety of different issues like you know is President Trump with what he's doing does that actually violate the emoluments clause or even love this kind of actual issue that we heard about last week does someone like Senator Blumenthal have standing or does he see the right kind of person to bring a case any of these really interesting questions to talk before The Supreme Court Justice Cavanaugh is on the court so what are the important things about federal laws it does address this kind of issue so federal law says a federal judge shell disqualify himself in the preceding in which is in partiality might reasonably be questioned I remember this was a Revenge filled statement that have not made during the hearing so would a Justice coming out of recuse himself and then if he did what if we had an eight-member court that couldn't agree on a totally unsettled question involving President Trump accuser is coming self-policing anyway right so he may be just wouldn't like emotions of the part of the parties but it's that means I think the short answer is it would be a mess because the number of people brought into the the Ambit of cabinets Target store in that speech right anybody who is democratic anybody who's a left-wing opposition group and there's a lot of people who could potentially followed in that definition are they all now no longer guaranteed a fair and impartial hearing by a judge or Justice Kavanagh and that's true even potentially if he remains on the lower of the federal appeals court to and that's real what was so unusual about his speech it's everyone expected that he would deny the allegations that he would say there wasn't enough evidence here that there's nothing here that can be said has been proven or can be but it was really that just the departure of from the Norms of being a open-minded rational level-headed federal judge did too many people even if they had supported Kevin of the floor or understood that he he answered of the pedigree of someone who was a well-respected jurist that was the shocking part I think we've seen so much and shifting of the behavior of politicians that maybe how unusual was didn't exactly land with everybody but you noticed it absolutely I think anybody who has watched you know any judge give a public speech they are almost measured and come to the point of being ridiculous they don't say anything controversial but this was this was a political speech and that seems totally at odds with the kind of position weed line on the court no matter what your political leanings are they don't want to think isn't this too much but someone can only imagine the Democratic nominee to the Supreme Court you know cheerful talking about you know his Vengeance all of these things it's remarkable it's a remarkable speech and that alone I think I should be some cause for concern. This is totally standing apart from the allegations against him his testimony open up a whole new Avenue of attack that really could give people a reason to question anything the Supreme Court decides which is not a good thing for us and our system in one of the things you know about the Supreme Court is as we've talked about before is that you know it stands only on its legitimacy it's got nothing else to go on to accept our belief in that the court is neutral and impartial and that's why they have the final word they don't have a phone where the Constitution because they have some great are babies behind them or anything like they're just with his we should have believed in their sort of neutral interpretation of law then of course this isn't the first time that kind of questions when raised but his testimony was so star it was so dramatic it seem to be kind of a real question in the Publix phase do you care at all whether this kind of question is raised when it comes to a Supreme Court Justice, after this if it is possible to hypothetically divorce the allegations from him in the process of nominating him do you think that his presentation of partisanship is enough to disqualify him from being Supreme Court it certainly is the question for anyone serious about the nomination process I mean you know we have gone from thinking about nominees providing testimony that said almost nothing about them to this example which goes in the complete opposite direction which raises alarm Bells about can this person actually be an open-minded dressed looking at the clans of all kinds of people testified isn't disqualifying what in the world could be disqualified in a senate hearing for confirmation of the Spring Court like that person came in for a job talked about the Injustice done to them as father I felt about it I'll just be like I need to steer clear this guy that's right but I think we're I mean it's true I mean we think a lot about the image we have of what address is in the American legal system but if you expand the window a little bit more I think we've changed our Norms about to this to be appointed in all areas of public life cleaning the presidency so things have changed pretty dramatically I think that we've lost sight of the idea that this really is a job interview and that's really all it is and it's not about connecting him in court not at all that's right the worst thing that happens to him is that he just stays in his regular job for Life For Life the show is produced by Elizabeth Joe and me Roman Mars you can find it online trunk on la.com on Facebook and Twitter all the music on laws provided by Doomtree records the Midwest hip hop Collective this new song you hearing is an instrumental mix of track off the new arturia verite album featuring our house Sims + are credits and I step Sims describe the album to me as John Carpenter inspired music from this week's dystopia that's inappropriate you can find out all about DMT records get merch and learn about current tours at Doomtree.
