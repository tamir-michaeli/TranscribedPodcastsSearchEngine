Is The Stock Market About To Crash  Bitcoin s Role  Amazon  Argentina   Ep223
what's up guys this is Carter with coin Mastery TV welcome back happy Thursday it's good to see you all next week hit that subscribe button hit the thumbs up on all that good stuff thanks for joining me nuts they were doing a little different app for a few reasons the first is that I did a poll as I talk to him Monday where we ask people what they want to see and macro is probably the biggest thing to start with and see what people like secondly as a marketer a lot of people drop off the videos about halfway through which is normal on YouTube videos building for the podcast but hopefully we can keep this engaging an app that you stay longer and you watch it and you rewind and watch different parts again and I miss everyone too busy so I don't expect you to sit there and watch video for 20 or whatever minutes about 30 minutes so I'll try this will see what happens and then we're going to talk about Amazon talk about the US Stock Market the dollar Index volatility index of the stock market S&P 500 what's going on with somebody talk obviously. Bitcoin the price of Bitcoin and then we're going to kind of go from there really necro heavy today and then I will like I said it was kind of bounced from there cool alright great so the first thing I want to talk about is Amazon now the feelings on everyone's mind and I treat about this how the stock market in my opinion is that stock market is not really going to stop being a place that money goes to as long as he's government seized currencies around the world to keep failing so you seem turkey Argentina Venezuela Brazil's kind of on the teetering on it right now South Africa is kind of teetering on it you may start seeing some of these other like Chili's kind of teetering on it to see these things happen with Italy before Iceland way back in the day and as it starts to happen Capital flows there's not a whole lot of places to flow because typically what happened isn't my flows into very very secure assets which is a store of the government but the problem is that if if this crisis it's called a crisis as it unfolded in 3 to 5 years is actually a currency crisis which is a government crisis fiat currency is she by governments you can't I put money into the public sector which is bonds and treasury is government debt you have to money is going to go flow into the private sector and even another publicly traded stocks private sector moons like it's it's a company is it's a business as i v c and that is kind of the thesis of all of this now obviously every anything can happen you never really know that doesn't mean she's going to keep going straight up for rubber it's obviously going to have retracements bounce up and down and bouncing around and maybe even consolidation kind of what we've been seeing with the S&P 500 over the last 8 months right was just kind of balance then it came back and got it all time highs we saw it back in 2015 but I think that we're just going to reveal see strength in this because it's not that the US economy of the US. Louis County a different obviously but the u.s. stock markets not that it's like good or everything is great and there's no problems it just means that it's Scott less problems and everybody else and money doesn't it doesn't it has to go somewhere it always has to be parked somewhere and it's always going to go to that the asset class that is the safest or the one with the growth starting with that kind of framework of macro of the big picture here in a company like Amazon so I posted this this is a weekly chart of Amazon on the NASDAQ you in public in what 97 ipo'd in 93 I believe but it actually public in 97 and you can see it famously, had this big run up in the.com bubble huge crash back down with myself over so you guys can see some prices if you're watching and you can see your $8 up to almost a hundred ten back down to 14 and then the rest is history not including any sort of dividends and are not dividends but like every stock splits movie did but if not it's treating it just crossed 2002 20 2017 right now I'm just a little bit of a delay on this but the comparison I like people make it look at this and then like man this is obviously parabolic it was compared to bitcoin and while it is parabolic and maybe it's not sustainable it's it's completely different than Bitcoin right because it has different fundamentals behind it it has different Revenue models as different profit margins it has different competitive Landscapes it has the ability to suck in different amounts of money than Bitcoins because it has growth numbers that can on some level justify it and when you look at any sort of prize especially in this kind of if you want to call it but this is the case valuations as they are related to any asset class especially stock market is really just a way for everybody to agree on a price so when you look at a balance sheet when you profit loss statement or an earnings report or a 2:10 or 10 km mean to put out is it purely a way for people to always say this is what it's worth is what I believe it's worth and that's what drives this price and still be able to say was overvalued some people say to undervalue but the price is the price whereas on bitcoin or any crypto asset Sochi last year it was almost impossible for people to agree on what it was worth and so what it was worth was completely determined by market speculation that's why it was a true bubble cuz it was built on Game Theory is built on who's going to you know someone going to buy it on top of what you're buying on as we create a bigger ecosystem when we can justify those evaluations were more people agree The Narrative start to consolidate that's when he gets the bility so first and foremost I think that's the first thing that's different right this is obviously a weekly Charter vs maybe a daily chart on bitcoin but the timeframes is less of an issue it's more of just what we're looking at because when you think about this it's almost a chart of just like how much money it's sucking out of and I like department stores or retail shops or even small businesses right by no means am I saying oh yeah Amazon to the best corporate Go corporate I I get it right but what I am saying is that this is a very good representation of a trend of consumer Behavior people putting money and believing in this company and actually using it as opposed to smell like Bitcoin which was a bubble that was built on speculation on what it could be not what it necessarily is and that even that's a pretty big but I think that's a good exercise to go through it to understand there are obviously different parabolic moves and yes this is obviously going to retrace in some way at some point when you zoom in a little bit you can see that it was Tracy's along the way but still having these massive weekly expansion bars for the most part and if you tired, takes it takes a dive Amazon's of a circle to go down with it because you looking to buy less and you know it gets pulled down with the index of speculators everything else but that's something to keep in mind as you're looking in as your evaluating you're any sort of investment where you're at 1 how you evaluate the how do you determine the valuation how the narrative is being talked about yeah I think that's why the biggest one right now it's S&P 500 is in many ways having an all-time high some people are saying no just the biggest bull run in history the thing is I think it was I think it's 2011 right here if we go to April 2011 and we go down to the bottom and I'm I'm not this isn't exact because I can't quite get in there it says its 20% music in 19% 19.6 % retracement or pull back I should say and the technical definition of a recession is 20% there's a hundred percent arbitrary someone just decided at some point hey look 20% if it hits that number were in a recession if it's 19.99 we're not in a recession like that's what that's why people are saying this is the longest Bull Run in history when in fact there have been multiple pullbacks that are in the ballpark of 20% one was 19 this won't get on 15% I'm a long way it's not like it's just been straight up and so when you think about it that way all of a sudden you start to realize that he may be there actually is a lot more Runway here because that 20% number is just a headline it's not necessarily that the full story something to keep in mind the other thing to keep in mind it's going to kind of push back on my own logic year if I don't know if it's going to blow off top or anything else one scenario that I keep coming back to you that I think is very possible is this idea that you know especially people like if you were if you're out to 50% of the words of coin Mastery are under the age of 35 based on analytics everything else and I would say 80% under the age of 50 and I think that lends itself to these two big bubbles than that mm bubble and the 2007 bubble and what happened with both of these is that symbol it was just it was a fast and severe drop I mean there's just you can go on YouTube and type in like you know Futures market flash crash 2007 Mac you can just watch the thing of completely crazy and S&P 500 doesn't really do it justice in 2001 NASDAQ chart to talk so you know 90% drop it wouldn't when people in that age bracket 50 and Below when they think about recessions or crashes River we think about severe drops relatively fast the vent also have relatively quick recoveries okay like it it takes what's a year-and-a-half two years to fully capitulate and then it comes back into wish 3s years back to the same levels and like that's the cycle top down top down but when you look at history tell me to go to the Dow Jones on the DJI see which one is going to have the longest history here this one go back to the 70s yeah let's go to Dow Jones chart I'm on the weekly chart for the Dow Jones and you look at what the market looks like basically after the war you had this essentially parabolic run and it never really had this like huge dump and then way back up it was kind of like almost like a 10 or 15 year consolidation. Where it just bounce up and down and if you held an ETF I'm a look at it if you bought stocks in January of 1966 in the Dow Jones close a bond Index Fund aside dividends aside had the same value in let's call it 1980 such 14 years without dividends and without inflation you're at the same level if you just hold it that's 14 years that is something that we are not used to being are we we have never experienced that people in that age bracket I'm under the age of 50 so it obviously I've never experienced it then 1982 I believe is when synthetic products were really sorry to introduce vividred liars poker go read that book by Mike Lewis it really talks about how Solomon Brothers Pioneer this R1 the pioneers and how they sold synthetic Bond beginning of credit default swaps right where you can package groups of real assets into synthetic products that you can then sell and then you make massive rips on the crew cuts on the on the sale that drove some of the biggest growth in history like some of the craziest growth ever culminated obviously he 1987 with a mate with a major crash which was built on you know it's like stock insurance which is essentially anti leverage. Which is why you get these severe chops so we're sitting here kind of big picture Dow Jones doesn't really have as much of a severe drop is I think a lot of people waiting for some sort of big dump right some like very fast very effective deleveraging situation deleveraging mean like you were in massive debt that represented value that didn't exist for the default swaps being the last one with a real estate bubble internet being internet and options in all the crazy value that was being manufactured in the 1990s with the internet.com stuff it just disappears cuz it didn't exist in the first place that type of deal averaging happened really quickly when you go up to up to where we are now there's a case that can be made for things like student debt auto loans housing to a certain extent corporate debt you know not to buy back but maybe there is something that could cause like a huge fast deleveraging situation but if there's no Catalyst it's going to drive that what may end up happening is that we get the similar situation like we had in the 60s and 70s which is actually deflation aerie in that what what happened is that we just kind of bounce around here for the next few years maybe two maybe three maybe four or five years and bounce bounce bounce and then something comes out in my opinion if I going to be something like security token IQ securitizing all these 10 trillion dollars worth of assets or some major breakthrough in technology some huge new thing that adds more value for C value to the economies of global World liking it 1982 where they created all these new Financial products and then that drives what will be like the biggest boom ever write like the Dow Jones 2 ghost of the $80,000 numbers and that to me is a situation that I can I believe is more valuable than a huge dump and then another kind of run up because we're running into a situation or even a financial situation in my opinion we're running out of stuff that's valuable there's just not enough things that people can put money into and I think that is what blockchain is going to solve I don't necessarily think like that means go out and buy security tokens themselves I think it means it went security tokens start securitizing assets though there will be a lot of new things you can put money into you and every like institutions and everyone else and that may happen the 20 22 23 Generation something like that that just goes completely crazy through the roof and then with all that you could blockchain companies in cells that have all this new technology of publicly traded companies that in to implement blockchain technology it's going to be a huge piece of that next run but the insurance we will see and I think that's all going to play out how it plays out now in the interim you're going to have this we're way in here you're going to be going to watch this whole thing happened with the US dollar right so you can see I got some levels down here with all these big bars I personally think that what's going to happen with this dollar like we talked about with the US dollar is it's going to come way back down to like 91 at some point between 9391 and then it's going to go up to like what the weekly here I'm in spring up to like 120 right is going to back up to you and this is going to be the impetus for just just massive Global changes could be the impetus for the stock market to go absolutely crazy in a few years it's going to be the impetus for a whole new reorganization of currencies and governments because what's happening now is it even at low dollar strength relatively low dollar strength but with strong Equity strength on top of sovereign debt issues you're seeing this happening in Emerging Markets I've got the chart appear for the inverse of the USC versus the Argentine peso or you're seeing just absolutely insane capitulation I think it's 85% down the Year this is horrifying terrifying if you live in a place of Argentina I bet his way like I mean I can't imagine what this must be like but this money is going to collect his value has to go somewhere all these people are still able to produce something there still owes infrastructure there still like established economies in these countries has to move somewhere chances are it's going to get sucked up by equities by the dollar whatever maybe so watching all of this keeping an eye on how this goes I personally really like watching the vix which is the volatility index on the S&P 500 you can zoom in pretty pretty close on this because it it had its understandably very very volatile in itself so you can see it popping up here but watching this is a good proxy of what's going to happen with the overall kind of crash or bouncing levels of the stock market in the US so all of this together to see how it's like all starting to connect I know that that's a lot of information but you see companies like Amazon which are being used which are like there's a reason why this should come down other than narrative changes narrative changes maybe because people are like well it's it's it's just too much but that narrative may be driven because our most recent history is built on this idea up crashing and recovering and not built on but you know what happened in the 60s with those just deflation and just like sideways action for a decade or whatever it may be right we have a different set of eyes looking at what we're looking at and then it really ties into the big picture with things like secure tokens in blockchain on the other side of whatever that happens with all of this as the Catalyst for really the the the next major explosion in in in prices and value and whatever else I may be and we'll see how that plays out with my former currency sample as well now it's could kick it over to bitcoin which I know Twilight if you guys are here but I do think that this stuff is interesting because it helps you understand what's going on but also like in the grand scheme of things assuming Bitcoin is the winner or is the does this does survive this in anyways like kind of nickel-and-diming about these prices becomes less important when you're starting to think on it 5 to 10 your window if you believe that it will fit into this whole narrative and so if we Zoom back am I going on 30 minute here you can see on Monday I drew this charm of myself so you guys can see the prices here I drew this I had this green boxes remember and we tested it we broke through we kind of Consolidated there's a huge supply like I'm guessing called supplies on but you can call it a big resistance which is where this green box tops now we stopped a little bit lower than I expected I guess the top of this previous issues since right around 7130 kind of stopped us out and we're coming back and you can see it this blue line which is at 70678 e or so which we've had these lines up for weeks and weeks I mean this is here really before I left last couple weeks and we're coming down and we're bouncing right around there and so you can see how these charge really just it's not that predictable by any means but they they follow once they're inside these blocks are these zones you can call him it'll do its thing but that the move is really going from the bottom or the top of the zone right and buying at the bottom is owned and going to the top is on and vice versa and not trying to predict if it's going to go in or not going to type of situation and so we're seeing if this is going to hold if this does hold work with Josh back down it comes back up and it retests it then that's when you might be that's actually it's a bullish sign if I know that it's a lot of like we got it we got a really dump this thing we really got to keep gone but in my opinion you're starting to see a lot of pressure from the from the outside world to starting to look for new Solutions I mean I posted the local Bitcoin data isn't up right now that the site is down for maintenance but you know the volume of people buying Bitcoin in Argentina has been going up as the currency has been going down the same in Venezuela and in turkey and things like that not as much as I'd like to buy the fine enough to make it the trend be going in the right direction but that changes that actually starts to give this some value which is the first time in a long time where we've had a story that is believable to the outside world which is really critical you're also getting light in destruction built on ramps all this Earth thing so this 6800 level holds it which is this blue line give or take that to me that's pretty interesting and then we really just got to get above this 8500 we get above that mme retested and keep going up and then the next one's going to be with 9902 10000 ish it's going to be that's a good sign it's very good so if you can see I mean on Monday I said I'm not going to short this I'm glad I didn't because yes you might get this kind of thing but to me that risk reward is very good because this 6800 is showing some pretty good support So if I shorted this I don't know I just wouldn't have been very interesting in my opinion so we're going to watch this or to see what happens and then hopefully it blasts off you know it so that I know this is a sharp by the way the localbitcoins you can go to coin. Dance if you want to see the data it was down for maintenance this morning maybe it's up but I'm going to end up there because spy a lot of info. Ever want to check anything out to scroll back to part of the video you that you're interested in and we will go from there like I said on Monday one thing I I will do in the next week or two is all do what kind of a miniseries where I talk about how you can get involved in any of these other markets purely because I didn't know how to do it but you were go like if I said Okay I want to I want to make a bet on the S&P 500 going down but I don't actually want to short the thing I don't want to sell my stock like you don't want to buy an option or future how do you even go about that and I think just knowing how to do it is important so that'll be an ongoing process I think know what you want to do anything you don't the sign up for it but I think it will be helpful especially as you start to realize that I know if you can make this is better return to cuz it's all leopard just like 5200 or some countries like 300EX leverage in Forex I mean this is much better returns at any altcoin last care if you do if you play your cards right so I mean there's there's a huge opportunity to also a lot of risk some that that's why it all very optional as everything goes not as professional advice as you guys will know as well I hope you have a great Thursday and I rock and roll I'll catch you guys on the flip side
