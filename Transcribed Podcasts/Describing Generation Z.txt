Of time usually been always a. Of about 18 to 20 years and we were focusing on generation Zed or Jen said which includes those boys which is the first decade of the 21st century from 2000 to 2009 the next expression was to cater for this means to provide something that is needed or wanted for particular group and if you're trying to sell something you need to cater for your target market and if your Market is Jen's at you need to be aware that they are Tech in a hyper informed they've grown up with connected technology and a very knowledgeable and this makes them extremely Savvy this adjectives mean smart and intelligent in this context that means they're able to make smart decisions about what to buy because they connected to so many sources of information and Virginia said this level of interaction and connectivity is the norm it's what is normal what is usual for them so where I struggle sometimes with molten life and Technology but it's easy well that may be true but I'm Savvy enough to know that it's time to end the program to join us again next time and remember you can find us on Instagram Facebook Twitter Youtube and of course website BBC learning English, and let's not forget all right rub English from BBC learning English
