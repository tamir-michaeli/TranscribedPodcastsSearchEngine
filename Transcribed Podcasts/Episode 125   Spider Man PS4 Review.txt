When will will break it down break it down in four different categories and then I'll give it to score so let's do that let's talk about story first and just fair warning everybody full spoilers are head so if you haven't played that you're planning on playing you don't want a room for you you might want to skip ahead to the end when we were talking about the score but in terms of story you know I thought Steven that it is built up very well I think that ax-3 is insane there's like so much going on and I do wish that was spaced out more no in the game or do you think they did it right I think they did it right I mean unfortunately gives away a lot of like the ending or not the ending ending but like the best shoe anyway now the turn I guess that's why I almost wish I didn't know about it cuz I was like is this coming Wednesday. Still out here when is it happening and I figured it'd be early on in the game and it's not and it's surprise me it makes sense why it wasn't it was well-placed but I would rather have them if showed something a little earlier in the game and maybe not even a story Mission during E3 I feel like that was a mistake and I upset by that the Character level up enough where they were no power still kind of show off what you can do and and see a bunch of the villains that we all know and recognize his that gets me excited right and the game through acts 1 and 2 you are very much like to believe that mr. negative is the the light main villain in this game and you're one of the lesser-known villains from Spider-Man but I think they did it really really well in a way that ties in you know Aunt May and MJ and Miles Morales and plays a role in the game as well I need to do that for a while but then they kind of pull the rug out from under you and say no thought that was it but it's not so did you like that kind of turn and how it turned into something much much bigger yes but again III I remember him out during the lines like he told us not to kill him during E3 trailer in the game and sorry I think I knew that Martin Lee mr. negative wasn't the the main bad guy and so I kind of like hurt a little bit and also I mean anyone who seen the movies could kind of see how the story was headed if you're paying attention from the very beginning like I thought it was going to happen like the first mission in the game I'm like oh that's not a coincidence like I wonder if he's going to become a game and something happened to me like I don't know if you got mad during first mission or what I think yeah I think something failed Mission and he got mad and like out from there I was like okay I have a feeling like Doc Ock is going to make make make his presence and I I didn't know I'd be the bad guy but so I guess I was quite just again I really think part of the problem movies that are guilty of this as well with their trailers they gave they give away too much and it's it sucks yeah I mean it's not like a negative to the story the story was good and I want to bash on him for doing it for a long time but quite a bit I think all the apps load smooth I think all the Acts were entertaining like the First Act was like Spider-Man kind of getting his like he just put away Wilson Fisk very first mission and he's like so he's like okay the cities now you know clean and something and it's like it kind of brings you in slowly all you could argue some of the story missions are a little slow early on but I think that it's like a movie set in the story or setting the tone for the rest of it and the game does the same thing and then act the turn of act 1 and act 2 is when I'm like damn the part at the the rally or whatever the wheel speed presentation I think was the mission that switch from act 1. 2 and that's when the game really starts to take off and then again the term from Act 2 and act 3 is what it's like oh my gosh there is a lot to take in Fisk says to Spider-Man / Peter Parker the you know you're going to regret this in a month you'll be wishing I was back and that's very much for Sherry for the game turn out to be you're not necessarily wishing you was back but you see the results around occasions of him being gone where as you know he claimed he kept the city under control and what transpires after that really very much says that yeah he did so he kind of turns into chaos in a lot of ways and not not suddenly but very gradually throughout the course of the of the story which is about 25 hours and it's like it's a pretty good campaign so buddy out early on you get the sense like I wasn't quite sure seal early with the cuz you get to play as Peter Parker and he spent a lot of that time and wanted to places either at the late fee center with Ant-Man and mr. Lee early on or with dr. Octavius in the lab we actually get to do some cool little mini games and stuff with you know science stuff and then unlock some stuff for you and it's pretty cool but I wasn't sure if they were sending him up to be more of a sequel or DLC or if we're going to see him in you know later in the game turn into. I just wasn't sure but that's the way it played out it I really enjoyed it in your right like in the game ramps up huge when that like medal ceremony happen and you start to see the level of what kind of what's going on but I do want to ask you like it you don't just placed my granny plays Peter Parker y'all's play as MJ and you play as Miles Morales in those MJ missions in Miles rattles missions where they're very much stealth missions did you enjoy those as much now so how come I don't need them bad stealth missions they take away from the font of playing as Spider-Man you want to go back to playing Spider-Man every time you eat play as either of them and they're just slow but also stupid if it'll wear like you should be noticed and you're not and it just like our this is ridiculous and there were missions where I just literally sprinted through and there was one mission in the as MJ and who was it tombstones like bike shop where do every like checkpoint had like it's on cutscene and you could literally like Sprint there before the bar filled up with making as much noise as possible and The Cutting would start and everything would be reset and so I did that and I got there a really really fast I don't know if you noticed that but I still like I tried to do that whenever I could because it wasn't that fun was the one in Grand Central Terminal where you're playing primarily is MJ but you're setting up Spider-Man to take down enemies yeah and that one worked pretty well because they're the Spider-Man elements there when I buy a Spider-Man game you know I'm not doing that to do stealth missions as one of the other characters I'm doing it to play a Spider-Man cuz that's awesome but yeah I'm with you you know I get why they're there I just I thought that was the week part of the campaign and I feel like there's a few too many of them yes so I don't especially 9-3 I feel like they felt like they had to get one more in for each of them towards the end and I'm like how I just want to get it to the end cuz I can see where this is going I want to get there I got like three times during the miles one and then I didn't either in the mj-1 at the end but it was like oh my gosh it was so long basically one of them happening is you all the or a lot of the most popular Spider-Man villains are the most well-known ones get released from the raft at the end of Act 2 and dog talks behind it and a lot of bacteria Spence you know the feeding those villains and ultimately back out in the end like were you satisfied and we'll talk about the mechanics of them in a minute when we get to gameplay but were you satisfied with those the way that story and folded and how you kind of took on each one yes I was I was told they were a little hard they could be there were a couple the Rhino one yes was was a little difficult I'll tell you don't think that this is an easy game it is not you will especially early on you will die if you times until you learn trying to play like Batman like basically what I did and I'm sure you probably did the same thing you're going to die it's not Batman where you just like you you counter and punch punch punch punch wait for them to attack counter punch punch punch punch it's not like that obviously to play it like Spider-Man would make some more fun and we'll get into that when you get in the game play but we're trying to do here in just a second but ultimately I think Insomniac stay very true to Spider-Man lore and they deliver very good story I was really satisfied with it and I'm actually really looking forward to the DLC which is towards the end of October I believe so really looking forward to taking him to that and even though that's in the window we're like Call of Duty's on red nose right on the corner I'm probably still going to play it so let's move into the game playoffs back and you know couple things I really want to touch on his obviously the swing mechanics that's a huge part of any Spider-Man game I'm also the fighting mechanics so what let's go to swing for so how did you feel that that was was it responsible for you to do like that and traversing around the city I loved it and it feels like accurate if your it's you can't just go from you can't turn 90 degrees and keep your momentum without doing it correctly like you have to swing around the building to to do it you can't like just turn them into and hope to keep your momentum and it is easy that kind of stop your flow or whatever but it's fun and it makes sense like there's something around you could potentially Okie web onto you can swing and if there's not then you can't like if there's no building to be falling until you can find a building to hook onto and then I found there was a learning curve to it I don't know about you but early in the game I found myself not timing it right not doing things right and I'd get you know where I'd be climbing up a wall on a building to get to a position where I can start swimming Again by the end though I'm in the city with ease and it's just really fun so it's not it's not that's really super easy but it's really fluid in it works alright I like to quite a bit yeah I added to the only issue I had with that reversal was when you had to get to a part where you had to stop at a certain spot it could be a pain just cuz of how fast Spider-Man moves to get this like I found myself like having idea when I press the button and it would go to the other side of the building and then I'd fall off and then I have to climb back up in the next you and I to overshoot it in that happen quite a few times even at the end of the game and it was a little Annoying and there was no good way to like to like slow down like if you could like hold a trigger and then like get off or like it out of quick mode basically so you can control and like more fine-tuning I think it would have been better I use reminder my reminder grapes but when everything else feels so smooth and you really notice the stuff that doesn't and that was one of them Baxter stuff you know the world yeah but I would be really strong so how about the fighting mechanic like the combat did you enjoy that it's it's enough like Batman in my opinion that it's familiar but it's also incredibly different yes I did like it I didn't cuz I didn't I didn't understand it and I got sick of seeing the the game over screen or whatever and having a few start but once I started understanding that like you can't take like you if you got hit like 3 times like you could die like three times was their limit in your your first Health pool and if you got the rocket especially early on in the game and saw you had to be quick and you had to learn how to like take out of me is out but once I learned how to use all the abilities in in sync with each other oh man it it's fun to go into the light bases and do the fighting just that's what I would do I'd be like I'd go to the bases and be like I can find a bunch of enemies here let me see exactly what I can do with this combo is early in the game you get sent to one of the bases right is sometime during act one at least just cuz I hadn't gotten the combat down yet and I remember you telling me we were talking over chat like when we were playing and you're like I'll go back and do more they're really fun and as in your right as I leveled up and got better a combat like yeah that's very credible fun and easy or not overpowered in them but you get a better understanding of how to go about doing it so I found that we really get last thing I want to talk about with kind of the gameplay mechanics is the amount cutie stuff that's in there so the quick time events especially with the boss fights or like things that end sort of admission at times it did you feel like there were too many or did Flo well enough for you in the in the game cuz that's been one of the complaints out there is on his way too much of it so you can call me a cheater and that's fine I turn in the settings you can go on the advanced settings and turn button mashing to where you just have to hold the button so I didn't had no complaints and I did it for God of War 2 and 2 mean button mashing is stupid I don't want to break my controller hit the square button or the finals Bieber and whatever have you 5 million times stupid I like the fact that I was allowed to switch it to where I just at the hold it and so I guess it's more of a reaction I think they were there cuz there was no other real way to do some of the stuff like when you're trying to stop a car like what else what how are you going to do without pressing the right or are 101 in quick succession or just hold or repressing Square Madison Square so I don't know what the hell they could have avoided it without just turning everything into cutscenes and I I think that would make people unhappy too I think it's a case of you're just going to complain either way maybe not the same people but the same amount of people so I had no issue with n I do recommend turning that off and I recommend turning it off and any game that has the option to where you can switch it to just holding the button cuz if you haven't said that or did you hit all I had I had a Button Mash and I wish I'd known that cuz I would have done it but yeah the I don't know why I feel like you know this one things I got a lot of criticism I feel like some people just aren't happy unless they aren't happy and you know it sits much it's much better for some people to get on message boards and whatever and complain because I get two more attention honestly and like I feel like that's kind of what some people want to do when it didn't we do need virtually affect the game for me and anyway like I didn't feel like at all that so let down I did all this to get to this and then it's like Ute you know sequence how are you supposed to do it it would just be a cutscene otherwise and people would complain about that and it would be born every 40 just want to be something where you hits you know Fisk enough for enough for whoever they just fall over yeah that like boring so I just I don't know why I felt like they did as well as they could I mean there's one you and me is like epic battles or moments in the game it's always a challenge figure out how to end it I am I don't have a problem with QuickTime events and maybe at one day and our show will get into a debate over quick time events on her normal show but a decent amount of them but I don't think they were crazy amount there's only one game I've ever played that I felt over did them which was rise yeah but that's a different thing I was fine with him in this game and I'm glad you feel the same way so anyone combat during the combat section like don't do what I did and try to knock everyone out like I did in Batman or like you doing Batman cuz you can't that's not it the best way to play try to do something cuz then they're out of the fight and it's quicker to a wall and it's the Best Buy I would go through moments in the game where I'm like I'm just going to fight everybody and then I'm like oh yeah I have all these gadgets and it took me awhile to just get used to that but once I did like it was it was on what user was lot more fun yes so in Manhattan and man that it's pretty detailed I enjoyed the the world and going around and seeing a lot of the cool Landmark Center in New York City. What do you think yeah I agree I know there were some grubs from from a summer viewers that didn't like that the majority of the game with outside and they wanted to be able to watch like Explorer Peter Parker's apartment for instance I remember reading that and some other stuff and like all the all the inside stuff is mission base but the outside was so detailed I don't know how you can complain and again I yeah it's okay I would be okay to explore Peter Parker's apartment for a little bit but how many times would you actually do it you would probably do it once and then you would be done and go back to playing Spider-Man for the rest of the game and I think that's an unfair criticism because the outside is extremely detailed like there are things that are in the real world Manhattan and then there are things that are in Marvel or the Marvel Universe Manhattan and and I don't want to spoil some of some of the stuff you guys haven't seen it yet but there's some cool like East there's a lot of Easter eggs in this game hidden throughout that are really fun to go find and I do recommend doing that if you were one that just like you just played the main missions and you didn't do any of the collectible stuff because you're missing a lot of the fun features of the game and the reason I say spoiler-free is cuz I'm hoping that the people that lives are listening that wanted to skip the spoilers just skip the story section part and went on so that's why I'm going to keep try to keep the rest of this problem and I'm with I'm with you like I don't I don't feel like I need to be inside that much cuz the cool part about being Spider-Man swinging through the city so that's the part of the game when you're climbing up if you look in the window it's not just Bland there's like actual Furniture inside and stuff like that white pretty much wherever you go in the city you wanted to but I did see a lot where people got stuck inside buildings I think your higher state building was one of the big corporate on that you could you could get stuck like basically in the game. You are falling but you were never moving so you were just kinda in the middle of the top of the tower of it but that's going to happen when you try to make Manhattan in a video game like there's a lot to the world and so I played it in both 4K and just regular HD and 4K looked absolutely stunning and then he even just regular HD look good that I noticed cuz I just playing 4K so much but it's still look great and I have no complaints about the art and graphics you know it'll be soft Dead with the division with New York City I'm equally impressed here but I think they did a really good job and billing the game the division has faults and other way in terms of building that world and having a lot of the landmarks are used to like they're there so I think they did a really good job with that and I'm with you on the world squishies in every single game and I don't want to know I'm not saying that to you it's like you know we got a comment Spider-Man's broken us okay I haven't experienced that and I don't I don't know if you understand what a broken mess is but okay like I just I didn't experience at all are you saying everything has loves so I mean I don't know if you if you're looking for it you're going to find it I guess and but if you go on wanting to have fun with this game we're going to have a blast but all right so sorry for all the extra stuff you can do cuz there's a lot it's not just the story and insomnia is really good at this they did the same thing with Sunset Overdrive with a lot of Collectibles and side missions and things to do that extend the life of the game out yeah another Collectibles and sunset were nearly as fun to get us a collectibles in Spicewood the next step for them in that cuz I think they played a lot of the traversal things to that they learned in Sunset to this game but it shows that they learn from all that as well in what. What were your favorite side missions and well first let's kind of detail at Omar go ahead backpacks to collect that include like it's a lot of stuff from Spider-Man's like younger days probably when he was in high school and just getting out cuz at this point in the story he's not working at the daily Prophet anymore so so it's decent amount in the Spider-Man by 20s so there's a lot of like a lot of the stuff in the back pack his stuff from his high school in early twenties and it's it's pretty cool to collect and honestly I just really I stopped doing the the missions as soon as the backpacks were available I collected all of them but my favorite things to do with the pictures the landmarks landmarks around taking pictures of the landmarks and the 3 Easter eggs that were there in the might have been a few more that I'm forgetting but there are three that I didn't expect like I guess I just didn't pay attention to you like that cuz they were shown in the like trailer and they were there they were known and I just miss it so I said so cool but those were fun and then there's like there's these cry missions that just kind of populate randomly where you have to stop people from doing a drug deal car chase or robbery or something those are all pretty fun there is space missions where you going to have to defeat waves of enemies and then there's some there's a couple like challenges that that the guy asked you to to do there's like combat still and like flying through and chasing after a drone and trying to fly through the little blue orbs to get points those are those are hard tonight and I'm like what only silver how am I supposed to but I know side missions to in the side missions are pretty good oh yeah you can go and get research points would you can apply to like suits or other things that you can get that are upgradeable for you and then the black hat yeah and then does the dogs challenges or side missions give you like coins like Tyler Cunningham play with the research and all those can be used upgrade the gadgets or get suits and there's a lot of suits in the game I like looking on one of the groups I'm in on Facebook like everyone seem to have their own favorite and I like that cuz you know there's no I still think the iron spider suits the best in the game but I'm sure there a lot of people out of this group me and that's okay but yeah it was fun no I agree in and when you like unlock all the things to do and then you look at the map like there is just a ridiculous amount of stuff to do in this game yeah and extends the game by easily 10 hours yes so now you're looking at a 35-hour game which is pretty awesome you know for forgetting this pretty fast-paced and you know story-driven it's not as deep and Emerson is your witcher's or Skyrim's or stuff like that but it's not meant to be but you still get if you want to do all very good 35 maybe even 40 hours out of the game which is great so I love all that stuff went in my favorites I'm with you I like the backpacks those are fun to get so cuz you just see all the little stuff for my Spider-Man lure yeah like when especially like the younger Spider-Man stuff like that which we see you in like every Spider-Man reboot movie you know and then that the landmarks I really enjoyed cuz you see the detail they put in a lot of the stuff and it's a mixture of like real Manhattan way cuz like one of them just you know this is not really a spoiler one of those like men's Madison Square Garden you know Statue of Liberty and then you have stuff that is from the Marvel Universe and they combined together so well and this is just really well done the black hat stuff is kind of fun the side missions I found I had a really good time with and I haven't got them all yet but the ones I've done it had a really good time with the some of the later ones were little and kind of fell off the bases are almost like a mini like a horde mode type of thing it's was waves of enemies coming at you it's there's a lot of stuff in there for people who like to do different types of things and it's not all good with the same type of player which I love and that's that's really cool so I enjoyed that as well alright anything else on the extra stuff no the black cat stuff I know Sarah is setting up for DLC with you confirm how many DLC for free I know you said you're going to play the new DLC when it comes out I'm going to wait for all of them to come out and then probably have one more playthrough of the game okay I'm hoping they're all out by the end of the year so I can maybe another playthrough in before Kingdom Hearts comes out in January but we'll see how well this game is like fun and just kind of silly and some ways but still challenging enough ways to make it in a rewarding to accomplish things and I feel like that would be a really good like departure from games like you don't read that or Battlefield or Call of Duty when those games right so story missions cuz there's some story missions I would like to redo without having start whole game over you know the ending is one of them and then the ending to act 1 mission right before the ending tact one okay it worked up no wait wait yeah I don't think it's okay so it's like the middle of back to you I'd like to redo that one but we'll see scene really shows figures they haven't really release everything but I would assume the games done very well you know some of you as a very loyal fanbase and you know whenever exclusive comes out aspect you know they were really smart to get this came out in early September before the you know we do know super XXX comes out starting in October so I think God sales for the funeral be pretty good and I think we'll see a lot of support for going forward and it's on the side that you know they giving somebody a ton of praise for how they've kind of handled overseeing the the making of the game and helping the sound that make the best game they can't so I think we'll see a lot of support but anyway let's let's give this game score so Steven wonder you first wear the unit at 10 out of 10 you know scale what would you give Spider-Man probably on 99.1 okay just I just have fun with it and it was death and that's why mine for me 49.11 and everything changed to do in my opinion and it's exactly the type of game I love playing it's a ton of fun if man if you're focused on a couple glitches in the game and stuff like that that's why it's not at 10 but if you're focused on a diet I don't know what to tell you like the game is fun and it's a good time going around the city the missions or well-done the stories as well done minus the like stealth stealth missions that's another reason it's not quite at that like 10 level for me or at least like a 9-5 I could have done without some of those I get that some of them are necessary but super fun really enjoyed it and I'll go at 9 at 10 alright but we both recommend for everybody to buy it is but that's the gist alright well let's get it everybody if you have any other people PlayStation get the game which I just really don't like at all either way I whether it's on Xbox or Playstation but it is what it is so
