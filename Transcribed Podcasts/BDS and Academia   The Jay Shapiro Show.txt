You know there was an old Jewish joke about how to seem to relate everything to Joyce is the standard joke is that a teacher asked her class to write an article for an essay about elephants and the only little Jewish boy in the classroom running Nautica the elephant and the Jewish Problem Kim seem to see that show how they're related everything is going on in the world now the reason I bring this up is because I show nautical it was just published before it was the set of made his voters during the highlight of taking place about 2 weeks and then sorry, I mention name and you are too because I don't think it's important but it relates to the Yellowfin the Jewish problem did they were the article is Christian Christine blasi Ford and the women of the Bible Christian Christian Blaze report of course if the woman had to choose a cabin of rape 30 years ago and then this article of this woman writes and women and I'm pretty much quoting in women telling intimate Roost the public sphere women raising their voices demanding be treated fairly woman challenging the leadership and compassion leads to their stories we find is in the Bible questions personal relationships these latest allegations of sexual misconduct against a judge bread, however she writes in true that women have been for a long time for lease Millenia to look in the Bible the heroines of the stories are the women who dared to challenge discrimination call but equally important addition to the humility wisdom commitment to Justice and this writer goes on to say the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to study their Bible take for example the story of The Five Daughters of Chillicothe was by borders appear in court to argue for a woman's right to an end should still at your sisters in the ancient world and they take their complaint to the highest court in the land at the judges Moses and Moses has humility and wisdom considered a marriage their case and in fact he was in there for another example of a woman in the Bible and the Book of Samuel and she's with these just have their children children she goes to the temple for a picture of pussy showing she's drunk because he sees their lips are moving what he's actually doing is praying so is she in Tales of the high priest white white shoes she corrects the highest spiritual thought so that's what she became pregnant headed toward example when I think the most George loosens are some of the story is Queen vashti it's red today going to be a party for all the men in the end of the week of the year is party to display your beauty and she refuses so his advisers Satan what state is an example of what happened in their husbands anymore so this question did he kick her out or do you chop your head off so and then he gets his new wife as to who is the heroine saves the Jewish people so why should I love Hunter are really important physical feature characters now what does Riders now saying that in our time courting out our time Christian blasi Ford Deborah Ramirez and most recently Julie sweating take care of those other ones who made the wrench in decision and speak out risking everything for the sake of Truth and Justice of the Supreme Court since we were right I hope it destroys is proof that there is an ancient president Whitaker trees down power forwards courageous enough to truly listen unable to see your man standing before you stories of ancient they make it weird to listen carefully it is a fun woman challenge one nation's leaders will be cool to me perhaps two members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have risen to power of who is it such a time it says I pray that they make the challenge that she had the quote most women this is this was written request before the final decision was made but it's interesting that turns out there for example Julie sweating it turned out she was apparently a liar Christian brazy Ford couldn't remember exactly what we did what to who and so forth but somehow this woman what are some fun biblical scholar grows back to the tradition of the old joke I guess you can call it to judge Kavanagh and the Jewish problem so it's Ranger sing III Pence's went to the listeners just the way you show how everything can be arranged or perhaps twisted and wanted to meet an agenda show listening to these people who turned out not to be quite telling the truth listen to these women essentially is important if you were and I believe it is by the way I believe of course you did you should be done I I wouldn't be little light in any way shape or form but the political a judge's ability and then that people look upon it as a woman's Rachel Ray Jewish a problem then I think something is entirely out of whack something stand by them selves have to be judge on the wrong brake shoes have to bring in the Bible in order to justify your own position Visa V your agenda rights and things of that nature but it seems it today this is the kind of thing that's being run late that's in part of what is known as the standard word for Chef intersectionality which holds that the various forms of depression racism sexism classism and homophobia intersection intersecting section of Oppression so according to this world are transgender male sexual Powerstroke marginalized groups each other depressed people should get together strengthening them against a dominant power structure so that's what you have heard this intersection of two in two and two senators are you don't understand that intersectionality seems to cover the whole thing so delicious just to show how I think you're getting lupus out of whack music video how they relate various subjects and since I mentioned it the cabinet hearings I thought I'd say one final word on this segment about the Democratic party almost two-thirds of democratic members of Congress 112 representatives in the House of Representatives and 34th Center sent a letter and appealed to US President Donald Trump and secretary Pompeo to reverse the decision to NYU United States contributions to the United Nations leave from work agency they claim that the administration's decision will exacerbate the already died during crisis in Gaza will 1 million people have the population depend on our room for food concessions the truth of the matter is your owner run short and 78 schools in Gaza Witcher 10,000 students but a lot of money on a money shoes for church and for buying Evan and hiding your emotions things of that nature and so it turns out that the so many you understand was withdrawn from safety reasons they're being harassed and prevent from carrying out their booties and it turns out the Democrat to Republican Democrats supporting them so Jay Street which is the left wing Jewish group claimed to the US administration's Reckless actions can I must be reversed another way to say say they have to keep supporting that group that supports terrorism I'll be back in after the break Israel News Talk

the president including is Jared Kushner and Jason Greenberg these meetings as she would you choose 100% by knowledge in Jerusalem as Israel's capital so he also uploaded Trump and Trump defense and offense to the UN speech open for Israel Champion Israel something in a few others have nine states has no situation is hard for the things you should do I think it just as an aside I think it's in your same thing you ever prime minister who speaks English so well that expresses himself so well and that speaks who ever prime minister who can represent a prime minister speech at the UN several weeks secretly in Lebanon because if I ran in hiding nuclear stuff at all kind of things like that speaks very well for Israel's Secret Service how did he waits the world up to the fact it is the
