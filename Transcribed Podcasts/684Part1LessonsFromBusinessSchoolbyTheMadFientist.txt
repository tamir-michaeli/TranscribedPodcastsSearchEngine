Com you stare at the final question you are tired and the word seem to melt into all the ones that came before them you're not quite sure what the answer is but a sense of relief starts to swell up inside you've finally made it to the end you take your best educated guess and you scratch the graphite into the final Circle you flick through the packet of paper one last time put away your pencil and calculator and head to the front of the classroom after handing in your exam you step outside in the winter hair instantly brings you back to life as the snow silently Falls around you you smile and breathe the fresh air deep into your lungs you're done with exams done with school and you have only one thing left to think about Santa okay you didn't happen exactly like that but I did just finish my last class for the year it feels really good as I wrote about in the free ivy league degree article I am currently pursuing a master's degree part-time while I work full time it is definitely a lot of work but it is also really rewarding this past term highlighted How Lucky I Am to be pursuing this degree because I had the privilege of taking a real estate investment course had one of the top Business Schools in the world it was one of the best classes I've ever taken and since the material is still so fresh in my mind I figured I'd share with you some of the key takeaways from the course while we explored some interesting real estate case studies did a lot of modeling and cash flow analysis and covered some really interesting real estate topics I'm not actually going to focus on what I learned about real estate instead I'm going to discuss some of the bigger ideas that came up in the course that can be applied to many different types of businesses and investments in each class I found myself scribbling some key nuggets of wisdom that I wanted to remember so here are a few of my favorites low-risk high-reward most of us probably understand that Investments with the possibility of high reward usually come with high risk while risk-and-reward normally go together you don't necessarily have to accept the high-risk in real estate as and other types of businesses the truly successful people are those who are able to identify the high-risk high-reward Investments that allow them to use their expertise to mitigate most of the risks rather than simply accept higher risk when attempting to achieve higher reward think about what you are good at and find Investments that will allow you to use your knowledge and experience to create low-risk high-reward Investments money is made when you buy not when you sell the profitability of an investment is usually determined by your purchase price not the selling price when you sell you are simply at the mercy of the market and can expect to receive the market value for your investment to maximize profits you need to make sure you obtain the best price when you buy the investment a quote that I wrote down during one of the lectures was low cost basis can write a lot of wrongs even if some of your assumptions are incorrect or he makes some mistakes along the way you can still be profitable if you got a really good deal on the investment when you bought it for example if you buy a foreclosed warehouse for a fraction of what it would cost to build an identical Warehouse even if you make mistakes when acquiring tenants in your vacancy rate is higher than you predicted it's possible you'll still be in a position to make a solid profit due to the fact that you bought the property for pennies on the dollar negotiation the previous topic leads nicely into another topic that was frequently discussed negotiation one ultimate power is the ability to walk away the buyer is usually in a much more powerful negotiating position because they are simply able to walk away at any time buyers who recognize this can use the ability to walk away to their advantage during the negotiations to don't make concessions without extracting something it's okay to make concessions in a negotiation but just ensure that you were able to extract something valuable when you do so for example if when purchasing a house the sellers make a counter offer that is higher than your initial offer it is okay to increase your offer but when you do try to get something else thrown into the deal that you want like an earlier closing date or appliances Etc negotiation is a given take so it's okay if you give a little as long as you're taking something at the same time three hear that in tomorrow's episode you just listen to part one of the post titled lessons from business school by The Mad fientist of mad fientist.
