Laser Advances That Changed Our Lives  Nobel Prize in Physics
science talk will begin after this short message everyone it's Brian Stallard and Andrea alfano again from Cold Spring Harbor laboratory we host a podcast called base pairs podcast about the power of genetic information and most episodes start with a big topical issue talk about cancer climate change even the pharmaceutical industry our mission is to show that genetic information can affect a lot of very big important aspects of Our Lives that's why it's so unusual that our latest episode starts with a bunch more specific subject and in fact it's really a story write the story of how a serial killer was brought to Justice and the questions that raises about who has access to personal genetic information in the meantime enjoy science talk this year's prize is about tomade from lights the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences yesterday decided to award the 2018 Nobel Prize in physics with 1/2 to Arthur asking for the optical tweezers and their application biological systems and the other has joined it too and Donald Strickland for their method of generating high-intensity Ultra sort of little houses in Hanson secretary-general of the academy earlier today and I'm Steve mirsky welcome to the Scientific American Science. Posted on October 2nd 2018 Askins Optical tweezers are the real life version of Star Trek's tractor beams although they're capable of grasping and manipulating only a very small objects like a single cell not a whole shuttlecraft and the optical pulses of maroon Strickland have made numerous applications possible notably laser eye surgerywhat follows is an edited version of the announcement and press conference to my right and left side because I'm not sure who is the member of the committee and an expert in the field of this year's price for asking was born in 1922 in New York City you made it remarkable invention at the Bell Laboratories in New Jersey in the United States a nice car rental vehicle polytechnique in palace in France and also affiliated with the University of Michigan in the United StatesDonna Strickland was born in 1959 in Gulf Ontario Canada which is currently at the University of Waterloo will Canada Lakeland did much of the groundbreaking work together at the University of Rochester in the United States now I would like to make some remarks about this year thank you for the past 60 Cades lasers and laser-based devices have become indispensable in many different areas of society with this long-range narrow beam that can be focused on a tiny spot a laser provide high power over a small area useful for cutting grilling welding and micromachining other applications bombbillions of people make daily use of optical disk drives Laser Printers and barcode scanners or are entertained by amazing laser light shows Millions undergo laser surgery or laser skin treatment the laser is truly one of the many examples of how a so-called Blue Sky Discovery and fundamental science eventually met trans for my daily lives today we celebrate two inventions within the field of lies of physics that have open new scientific Vistas but what's more have already let applications of direct benefit to society allowing control of tiny living organisms mm2 vacation technique and they began construction of high-intensity compact laser systems and with that I have over to my colleague is a Lawson alter asking invented the optical tweezers and he realized that he could using the radiation pressure from an Acer push it snow in the Microsoft transparency here in the directional realized that because they're laser beam is not imagine it's morning passing the cemetery be pushed into the sun through by so-called radiant gradient forces and finally it took an honest and focused the beam so that they could trap you could keep the smallest player fixed in Space the small smear that was the real breakthrough. Breakthrough came when it alteration demonstrated that you could track in the freezer viruses bacteria and even giving saddest now we come to the second part of this year's Nobel Prize to get out of here and there. Strickland and go to see here where is the development of Palace laser pumps intensity as a function of time from the very beginning when the first laser was constructed in 1960 by my mom and up to 1995 and what you see there is a first short increase in pulse intensity but then it became a problem because the technology of that time getting them it was not possible to go to higher intensity because of amplifier damage and the way to come over this hurting boss the invention of Detroit pal sanctification by motor win streak land and this was really the Coral House you stretch it in time maybe federal Towson and then the amplitude of the palace we B trees also Factor 2010 you take the pump and sending through the amplifier the policies interest in amplitude and finding the things that you compress the policy so that it has the same generation as your input but not with the much higher intensity after the invention of the CPA technique basically every four to five years the pots and pans if you doubled and this gave a possibility of applications both in basic science and Inwood practical applications between 10/200 and 2 seconds from Tampa second is a millionth of a billionth of a second and India per pound at UC and very high intensity pounds per second like this and these promises can be used for laser particle acceleration you won't accelerate electrons or protons and this is now a development that we can order the seat could be important for cancer therapy in the future in the middle of time that you'll see policies calming drops give you 1,000 per second the intensity of the little bit lower and discounts I'll adopt you the truth and you will see the signs call Apple II signs seconds is even much shorter than a femtosecond 1000 + by + houses that you can explore how electrons are moving at Thompson molecules in the border now $100,000 is per second but being extremely useful for high perception interaction with matter and I'll give you an example how they can be used this is not one that is used to correct myopia or nearsightedness and then December 2nd laser is in the cornea creating a small down shaped piece of tissue which is colder Atlantic you'd the Tampa Bay Suites also used to make a small incision in the cornea so that we can be expected with the instrument and by doing this you aren't decreasing the worst the refractive power of the eye so that your focus is now on the retina and not a little bit before the retina. So finally we are today awarded the Nobel Prize for groundbreaking inventions in the field of basophils 6 to Authur Ashe skin that are motor oil and don't eat too much we may not have one of our new Nobel laureates with us on the phone dr. Strickland are you there right now we're having a press conference here at the Royal Academy of Sciences launch number of journalist and I'm sure they would like to ask you some questions from Swedish television congratulations I was curious about how you found this as if it was described as a blue sky discount was already going on but I guess thinking outside the box to stretch first and most people are amplifying and trying to say thank you in Swedish TV for congratulation on the price you are the third woman ever getting the Nobel Prize in physics well obviously we need to celebrate and hopefully I don't know what to say week 5 Moto, yes this gentleman over there from the Associated Press Facebook congratulations and how did you react when you receive the phone call this morning what was your first and your price ever these are their stories part said it was Gerard of course he was my supervisor adventure and he is taking it so so happy that I can also one I think that you know he he makes so many discoveries early on that other people have done great things with it yes I'm out of Smoke Filled from the daily dog and sneak in terms of its a newspaper of practical applications that make some difference in people's lives what are your favorites people for something practical and it was already discussed in the press conference but it's still being used mostly in Washington DC but I think the push towards higher densities and short of pulses and thankful commercial Nations I'm sufficient as a song from Green post and Chan radio I just like to the previous question so you know what you feel that you think your invention can be used can you elaborate a little bit so many different ways it is using a lathe Machining the hope is that it will work it up translations of being built around the world right now some of them are hoping to do laser acceleration some of them are hoping to you no answer to be just about everywhere high intensity lasers just because it's the way it interacts with the median is different and some you think of this development a job started and we can expect much more to come that's exciting news thank you very much for being with us come to Strickland and we look forward to seeing you here in Stockholm in December now are there questions to the panel please did you talk to all of the this year's Lawrence yes we did and talk trash can told us that he may not be able to give any interviews because he's very busy with his latest scientific paper just been from Associated Press I think we spoke in the last few years about female representation within this prize I understand that you cannot talk about people that have been nominated would you be able to give us an idea of the percentage of women that's a nominated for these prizes we had enough. I don't have the statistics here in front of me it's it's a small percentage that's for sure and that's why we're taking measures to and encourage more nominations because we don't want to miss anyone let me point out that these measures that we have been mentioning in the last few days All Is Lost part of a long process and has actually had no effect for this year's price and it's important to remember that Nobel Prize is awarded for discoveries and inventions and those who receive it have made major contributions to humankind that's why they get the price may I please give you the percentages of course but let me just point out that the percentage reflects the number of women in science Buck you should go back 20 to 30 years so the number has been increasing steadily over the years but the number of nominations for the reflective percentages as they were say to a 3-D case back in time right back after this so listen are what do you know about the Golden State killer I'm asking because this murder case had us thinking it's Andrea and Brian again from base pairs and we're excited about our latest episode which takes a closer look at the peculiar arrest of California's Infamous Golden State killer it wasn't eyewitness testimony that reopen the seemingly unsolvable Cold Case over Decades of Investigation detectors never had such a lucky break a break in the case did finally arrived thanks to the rising popularity of direct-to-consumer genetic testing services will finish telling his tale a little later so stay tuned following the announcement and press conference Swedish journalist Joanna Rose spoke with Matt Larson about the Nobel Winnie research Max Larsen member of the Nobel committee for physics for today it was about to change of life sounds like science fiction can you just say something of the history behind the trash can very soon after the first laser have been constructed realize that somebody that was available the tune of light of it totally different quality than you had to go earlier and he started to think about how can one use his tool to manipulate objects and then he realize that by thinking about this you realize that you'll take this more Microsoft or should be possible even if the radiation pressure from the laser is very small it should be possible to manipulate such a sweetheart and he had demonstrated this so that development development of manipulating at Don's something much smarter than Microsoft but he was just want you to think about something much more complex than a sweetheart namely viruses bacteria even leaving says he could try and that was supposed to be a breakthrough that manipulates such complex objects you can say that this dream of using translation pressure of a sample I said a lot of rage is Joey Sergo long time back, you know what I realized that radiation from the Sun could explain how to combat a sore behaving when they are coming in and out in the neighborhood of the sound so it is an older subject but it was raining the invention of the laser that pertain to the laboratory light sources that would work I have a nicer so would it be possible to use Optical tweezers in a moving object in space give me I'll be out in space I guess so I don't talk about that direction really button in Spanx I mean I guess there you want to have if you want to have more than one spaceship what you really need is to keep them extremely precise with respect to each other and the database record plays a very important role and this is the development I think we're going to see in the next 20 years for example in the internet in space-based detector for gravitational waves another license place in extremely important Road and the other part of this year's price is about Kylie fences in major spiritual also did they want to develop such thing but I think around seven I mean if your soda carb I did that was some sort of a tattoo over 15 years and as a physicist you always want to go to the New Frontiers you want to push the palace intensity you want to go to higher and higher intensity but you really start to not only talk to them but really too serious in friendship and this is something that really started with the invention of the CPA technique because then you'll get ounces of sufficient a high-intensity so that when interacting with iPhones and molecules it was no longer small perturbation but it was a drastic change of the electron shell of the item and they stand led to strong filter 6 and the Apple II Metrology intersects Apple Second Time Around 995 Douglas no no clear understanding of what would happen if you were exposed at comes to such strong feelings from Malaysia boxes can take a movie of what's happening in the electron motion in the morning. Or @com and this was of course science fiction or for a long time and I kind of never stop how Winton scan those laser beams be your ideas how you can do basic science and then is suppression of the scale and how much you can go get your can do things and so on them. So I don't stop and see that there is this ring go on those instruments of the Wizards Pacers is I didn't I didn't have time to prepare but it can either be very very compact instrument that you use for eye surgery which is something that fits easily into it I mean it's bigger than the one you go to the dentist for the same size when you come to Lacey lost my acceleration in about three and a big lasers I mean the feeling up a big laboratory studies scale of an uncircumcised and interaction with something pretty sympathy or do you want to drain the oil don't make sense since 1:00 ampuh size rated high intensity from here and there if you ain't direct3d highest intensity pounds is with my crew then of course you're creating extreme conditions that doesn't really exist naturally about for example my excess skin in in astrophysics in the interior of planets and so that's that's Direction I would go laboratory astrophysics you know when you have your son this year is not only the Third Woman in history but also she was a PhD student a convention for students today to pick up important issues to work them I think you should at least he's easier to potential PhD student you should look for something that really interests you you should look for groups that are very good in that particular area that interests you and then try to start to get the PSP possession amount of these groups I think if you're still with them something that you were inspired I don't think that's not right that you were on the wrong track. Choose the topic first then look for people that are doing this and try to select the best it's not easy thank you very much I'll be back in a moment Andrea and Brian for base pairs here one last time and that lucky break that led to an arrest in the Golden State killer case it wasn't exactly luck genetic testing is come a long way and in some ways law enforcement using it to their advantage was an inevitability Truman to boost pairs to hear from the founder of a service that helps fill the gaps in family trees the same site that unknowingly helped to track down the Golden State killer and then hear from a pioneer of genetic sequencing technology he explains how we got to this point and what today's technology means for our personal privacy is answers may surprise you who wager you won't find these stories anywhere else so check out these pairs the podcast about the power of genetic information from Cold Spring Harbor laboratory find us on iTunes or wherever else you get your podcasts 2015 the international year of the lights and light base technology come on just take a step up because everyone that knows about this is right here with us today come on tell him to the like Each one teach one we going to be all right with every man woman and child support and I am the light thanks to people like I would always done Charles K I'll be back tomorrow with coverage of the Nobel Prize in chemistry we leave you with music from the 2015 International year of light Global initiative new Nobel Laureate Girard Maru is composer and contributed some of the lyrics for this Beast along with Jerome Luciani and Vince Macclenny that's Vince Macclenny performing step into the light miseducation is important for our health and our future we need to change our ways we got to open my mind and keep it open wine without like there will be no life we got to be more careful about what we teach our Sons & Daughters wake up people because it darkness is upon us step into the light 2015 the international hear the Light & Light based technology tractor beam
