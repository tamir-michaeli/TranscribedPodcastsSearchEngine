welcome to food psycho podcast about intuitive eating Health at every size body Liberation and taking down diet culture I'm your host Christy Harrison and an anti diet registered dietitian and certified intuitive eating counselor offering online courses and programs to help people all over the world make peace with food join me here every week cuz I talked with interesting people from all walks of life about their relationships with food and their bodies remember I was sneezing hey there welcome to episode 169 of food psych I'm your host Christy Harrison and today I'm talking with Christine Yoshida mental health counselor and certified intuitive eating counselor who also has a background as a personal trainer she joins us to discuss how Fitness culture affected her relationship with food in her body why the diet mentality and quote unquote clean eating can make health problems worse how young children can be influenced by diet culture using empathy and connection to spread the anti-diet message and so much more I can't wait to share a conversation with you in just a moment but first let me answer this week's listener question which is from a listener who gives their name as black and white think who writes I'm entering recovery from severe long-term disordered eating I was listening to one of your podcast episodes where a certain topic came out to which I could really relate I can identify myself that I think in very black my terms and have many food rolls around eat it if I know my personality type tends to jump from thing to thing and try to find Comfort every single time I try to give up a disordered eating I feel as though the disordered eating is all I do most days I'm wondering what you would suggest for someone like me who on the one hand wants to go all in and admit to the world that I've been living with us alone a part for my husband now knowing for years I need to enter recovery by exposing it but on the other hand I'm scared that this is part of my black and white thinking and false expectations about recovery or to put it another way once I became liberated by hearing about health at every size particularly gaining knowledge on the physiology of Eating Disorders I become very obsessive about the physiology in the factual information on eating disorders to have begun to look into studying human biology and sociology I don't have to stop myself and ask is this part of your all-or-nothing thinking like if I'm going to live with recovery that I want to read all the books and know about everything to do with eating disorders I feel as though my life is way cigarette I'm missing everything at the disordered eating won't piss off basically I'm wondering if being a black and white thinker can be a good thing like becoming an advocate for health at every size or telling myself that I'm okay with eating whatever I want cannot be a way to look at it my husband identified that I have a loyal dedicated personality and morals which I feel is okay if I can put them to good use I going all-in to beat this disordered eating and helping others to what are your thoughts thank you so thanks so much for that great question and before I answered is my standard disclaimer that these answers and this podcast in general are for informational and educational purposes only aren't a substitute for individual medical or mental health advice yeah so this is such a great question and there are so many layers to it so I'm going to try to answer it in a lot of Shades of Grey actually so first of all black and white thinking is so common and disordered eating so you're not alone the disordered mindset is very rule oriented and regimented and all or nothing and the physiological changes that disorder. creates in the psychological changes that creates can actually exacerbate that rigidity so you know if you have an underlying tendency to be sort of All or Nothing already and that might contribute to the development of disordered eating and then the physiological changes and psychological changes that happen to you with disordered eating can just make that problem that much more entrenched to make that way of thinking that much more difficult to get out of and diet culture in general really operates on a black and white dichotomy to you know it's good or it's bad it's right or it's wrong like how you're eating is correct or incorrect and diet culture really insist that one way of eating and exercising is quote-unquote Success while the other way or no way that differs from whatever that diet du jour is telling you to do is quote-unquote failure and of course that leaves no room for what actually feels good to you right and that's how people end up getting so disconnected from their internal wisdom you know that natural intuitive eating scale that we are all born messy no diet cultures black and white way of seeing things comes into play and disconnect us from what really feels good because of her constantly being told that avoiding a certain food nutrient is quote-unquote good and that's the way to have quote on quote Success but we really want that food or nutrient then suddenly were at odds with our desires what we're being told is good is at odds with what we actually want what we actually might feel good doing for ourselves and so this way of thinking you know the diet culture really exacerbates is harmful to us but it can be hard to let go of those rules and that black and white way of seeing food especially you know good and bad categories healthy and unhealthy because those rules feel so concrete right they feel like a Shore thing they can make you feel okay and certain in a world of uncertainty and it's hard and uncomfortable to sit with uncertainty so of course we want things that make us feel more secure but the thing to keep in mind is that this security that diet culture supposedly gives us is only temporary it's really a false sense of security and the uncertainty that comes with recovery is uncomfortable yes and we have to learn to tolerate that discomfort and that can be challenging that's a part of recovery really but being able to sit without uncertainty really ultimately opens up so many more doors including the path to true peace with food in your body that's what happens you know that's what comes out of recovery if you can stick with it and if you can sit through that discomfort of not knowing and not having the quote-unquote rules to follow so in terms of throwing yourself into recovery I would say that in some ways I can definitely be a good thing like a specially if you Channel it into getting into treatment so that you can heal and opening up to treatment providers like therapist and dietitian to our experience with eating disorders and experience with health at every size is an excellent way to channel that desire to go Full Speed Ahead into recovery and to open up about it you know I wouldn't necessarily go shouting it from the rooftops to everyone else in your life just yet though because sometimes having to deal with other people's reactions to what you say you know like reactions to sharing that you have this long-standing eating disorder can actually hold you back in recovery because people can say some pretty triggering shit so it's great that you told your husband that's awesome and if you have a few other clothes people in your life whom you feel comfortable and safe tell him and that's great too but I would just be judicious about who you tell because sometimes people's reactions can actually be problematic and unhelpful and and make it harder for you to recover so now in terms of throwing yourself into studying eating disorders and all this information that your devouring I would also proceed with caution here and make sure that you're looking at content that's helpful and not triggering and I can tell you why the creator of content to help people in recovery I do a lot behind the scenes to make everything I'm sharing is as safe as possible like bleeping out weight and calorie numbers as you probably heard he listen to the podcast before I added out statements that could be misinterpreted or that aren't appropriate for people in early stages of recovery so if one of my guess that's something sort of off-the-cuff that I'm like that's a little bit potentially triggering I'll take it out and I know that not everyone who produces recovery-oriented content is anywhere near that careful and there are a lot of supposed recovery resources out there like websites and books and YouTube videos and social media channels and even other podcast that can actually take your disordered Thinking Up A Notch and give you harmful ideas of new disordered behaviors to try or make you feel like you're not sick enough quote on quote to deserve care or lots of other harmful outcomes from potential triggers that are out there so I would love to recommend a resource list that I can guarantee isn't going to be triggering but honestly I don't think that's possible because triggers can often be very individual and also they're just they're so rampant in the resources that are out there so I think the best way to find content that you trust and content that feels okay to you is to pay attention to how you feel when you're consuming it and notice whether it's giving you inspiration and stoking the fire of your recovery and getting you in a place where you're like yeah fuck diet culture you don't look at all the ways that is harming us I'm ready to change and ready to recover like let's do this and if that's the case then that's the mark of content that actually helpful to you cuz it's channeling your tenacious spirit in a direction of recovery that's awesome but if you notice that the contact you're consuming is putting you in a headspace that feels spinny that's like the best way I can describe it where it's like you're just spinning around in your head while you're like this person just said that they ate calories in did Y hours of exercise but I only ever eat Z calories and doobie hours of exercise so maybe I should just do what they say and then I'll be okay you know like if you get into that place where you're feeling really stuck 10 little details and thinking you should go back to disordered eating behaviors for just one more try before you go into recovery that's a sign that you're being triggered and maybe it's time to step away from that content and of course you know there can be content that's mostly helpful but somewhat triggering or mostly triggering but somewhat helpful and any mix in between so just notice how the contact you're consuming is affecting your mood and try to make self care decisions based on that you know if you noticed or getting into that spinny place where you're really in your head and hung up on details and that happens over and over again with a particular type of content maybe don't consume that content anymore you know and I say this because when you say you're getting into the physiology and biology of it some of that contact and definitely be very triggering cuz it gets into two numbers and how the body works and depending on where you're at in your recovery you could be trying to game the system are trying to figure out like there's a part of you maybe that's trying to figure out the best way to do disordered eating you know how to be a better disorder dinner so check in with yourself about that you know check in with yourself and be honest with yourself if there's a part of you that's looking to that content as a way to like try to master disordered eating as opposed to a way to truly recover and if that's the case and it usually is for most people in early recovery maybe try to take those pieces of content off the table and just consume things that make you feel really inspired to recover without the spinny feeling now in terms of weather being a black and white thinker can be a good thing I think the term black and white thinking generally has negative connotations in our society at this point in time but what you're talking about where your husband identify that you have a really loyal dedicated personality and morals and I think those are actually wonderful qualities and they can definitely be a huge asset in your recovery so high that dedication apply that loyalty to yourself and your recovery and I think it's it's just important to remember that when you dedicate yourself to Healing from your eating disorder you're not fighting against yourself you need to have compassion for yourself when it's inevitably harder and less straightforward to recovery than you want it to be you know I don't know if you've seen that picture where it's like expectations of recovery it's a straight line pointing kind of Upward at a diagonal and then it's like reality of recovery and it's a squiggly line of all over the place with lots of ups and downs and yes it ends up moving in this sort of upward motion as well but it takes a lot more upside down to get there so you don't make sure to apply that loyalty and dedication to yourself your own friend be your own compassionate advocate in recovery which means that when you have slip-ups where you fall back into a disordered Behavior you don't beat yourself up instead you're there for yourself like a loyal friend you comfort yourself you ask yourself what you need you give yourself some perspective each and every time you show up for yourself and I want to say that even learning how to do that even learning how to practice self compare like that is a huge step and it's one that took me years of therapy to be able to do consistently and I know takes many of my clients years as well to implement in their life and a consistent way so don't beat yourself up over not practicing self-compassion quote-unquote perfectly either cuz it's a journey you know it's all a journey and like I said before I would really recommend finding a good therapist who can support you through this and through the other aspects of your recovery and also finding a dietitian who can help you with the food piece of recovery and help you break through those food rules so you can look at Hays Community, that's a Jes community.com and search the registry for referrals and also go to intuitive eating. Org and check out the certified counselors directory there those are two good places to look for providers because you know General they're probably going to be a little more aware of diet culture and weight stigma and the pitfalls of those things in recovery from an eating disorder and I know it's an investment to do therapy in Detroit counseling for eating disorder recovery I I get it believe me but if you can swing it financially including perhaps finding someone who's able to do a sliding scale and those those providers are out there and if you find a treatment team you really click with it is one of the best investment you can make because it's an investment in your recovery it's an investment in your future and really your happiness and then On a related note although not directly in answer to your question I just want to Circle back to this idea that the term black and white thinking has negative connotations at this point in history because I've been seeing some comments here and there on social media and around the internet lately that accused of Health at every size and intuitive eating movements of being caught up in black and white thinking especially when we're talking about the harms of diet culture and weight stigma and I think it's because our approach feels like a very Stark difference from the diet e approach to nutrition and health that people are used to do you know cuz we live in diet culture and that's what's all around us so yeah Health Everett 72 repeating feel like a radical departure and maybe as contrasting as black and white but I also think that people characterized this approach as black and white as a way to dismiss it and that's actually a form of tone policing that's used by members of a dominant group in his case diet culture who aren't able to sit with the discomfort of looking at the harm that their own behaviors are caused or the harm of buying into a paradigm that they're really invested in and we know that there are millions of people who are super invested and diet culture because they've spent so much time and money and energy devoted to shrinking their bodies or eating quote-unquote perfectly and they're just not ready to give that up yet and so I find that people love to demand quote on quote nuance and conversations about intuitive eating and health every 5 but don't actually love to hear the Nuance when it comes to challenging the status quo you know the weight stigma and diet culture that runs rampant in our society and of course if you listen to this podcast and Eldon. the resources on attitude of eating and health at every size you know that there's a ton of me wants all of us to Healing your relationship with food and not falling back into the diet trap and it's not like you just flip a switch in your attitude of food are you're done with that culture like there's a ton to unpack and explore and unlearn and is all very nuanced so I just wanted to highlight that as a way to say that if you do come across people characterizing this movement as a black and white thinking quote a quote which is kind of a new maybe Trend I don't know I seen it a few times but it's worth just asking yourself what the person stands to gain from that characterization and who benefits you know and other it benefits the status quo to dismiss concerns about how weight bias and diet culture harm people's relationships with food and their lives it benefits the status quo to dismiss all of that as black and white thinking and these are matters of social justice and there are always going to be people who are uncomfortable with change who try to maintain the status quo by cutting down mischaracterizing the people who are fighting for justice that's happened in pretty much every social justice movement in history that I can think of but if you're here listening I know you know how harmful dieting and stigmatizing larger bodies are for people's mental and physical health I know you know that I know you've probably had a lived experience of the harms of those things so trust in that knowledge trust in your own intuition your own experience and explore this new paradigm that does feel like such a radical contrast from the status quo without listening to the haters or just want to dismiss this also that they don't have to change so to submit your own question for a chance to have it answered on an upcoming episode go to Christy harrison.com questions as Christy Harrison.

the responses I've heard from your other people in your podcast and I can empathize so much with others and also kill paying for those people on the podcast that I might not have had the same experience me personally I feel really honestly grateful for my childhood I really had a Wii food was really in abundance for us you know I grew up in a Hispanic side in the my dad's side was Italian and Scottish and we really food was just how we got together it was how we socialized a group actually poor but I wouldn't have known as a kid if we didn't have enough food I didn't know it I just know that there's times I know now as an adult that we would go to my relative's house and eat or our family would buy each other groceries and stuff but other than that I mean I just remember the holidays and barbecuing where's always with our family and cuz my mom is the youngest of 9 actually and so there's a lot of relatives around in California so that was in as a child of really great experience yeah and it's that's interesting that you had like the family support we're even if you were struggling financially you would have known that because you're able to rely on family members for sure and then even live with some of my family members at the kid but then my dad got no better job and we end up moving across to Washington and that time we changed from low SES to middle-upper class and and still have been food was in abundance I remember that's when we have some like all the kind of foods that maybe I didn't have I just remember having we were family there was no moral obligation with food we had honestly All Brands all sugary soda there was like no kind of off-limits our cupboards were always full with like different types of food and we were actually at the house that like the kids always came to remember my friend being obsessed with a cover the call my gosh / Roll-Ups and Joe and ice cream or and other different nutrition type of food all food what kind of legal that's awesome that experience so much from people and I wonder if I was that house for some kids growing up and just didn't know it but the kids who are restricted of foods at home and they go to the kids house but has all the fun foods that where it's not a big deal and you're allowed to take whatever you want from the cupboards it's like those kids were restricted get so kind of upsets that they're like oh you got to eat off as soon a while I'm here and it sounds like you never had any of that which is nice I mean not looking back at my friends I could see that so much luck maybe what you experienced yeah I mean my my family was very much like that like what you're describing to actually was you know how to lot of fun foods and snacks and all those things around and never any prescriptions are restrictions on it but I think some of my friends definitely had like dieting parents and it was like all you know low-fat or fat-free foods at their house and I remember being like oh this is weird you know this food is different at still a tad I so enjoyed it but it was like a different I was sort of curious as to why they didn't have the stuff that I had like where are the gushers where are the Oreo has a pair of those so bad so it sounds like your family wasn't like hell Fest at all when you were growing up I want to know if I do I think I have a lot of privilege personally and so I might not have received the same message is me and my other families had about like finishing their food or stopping certain food I think there's like a wide range of body sizes my family like most people and I just was very naive to a lot of things but looking back I feel like my other relatives might have had a different Spirit send me yeah that makes sense so they got to have Diet culture messages about their body size was you didn't know it was more like a sport they telling me to eat more like the doctors telling my parents I need to eat you know I don't size meal at McDonald's versus it because I was just so active that was my experience with food and kind of being told as a child so it sounds like your relationship with food then was pretty intuitive like you were left alone for the most part other than to say like hey more which is such a rarity and diet culture except that she knew I would like that you would get more for me but yeah I was very intuitive I'm soaked again grateful that I had that growing up I had two things unfold for you then as time went on did you continue to have attitude a relationship with food all throughout childhood and Adolescence or did it start to get murkier at some point I mean guys are all this one experience I was playing volleyball on high school cuz at the end of my season and the coach like Linus up and said pointed people you need to lose weight can you need to gain weight I know right so awful so awful and careful and then I think I started getting those messages like oh being in a larger body is not okay and then I know messages in my family because some of my family members are in a larger body like that was kind of even though it wasn't I told I need to change my body there was still a messages like that's not okay to be in a larger by so that was there so I would like one experience a high school was just so awful out loud oh my gosh I hope that sounds like that person that coach had a really disordered thing going on themselves then like in high school and it kind of started changing I started again without was just wine experience and then my senior year in high school I started dating a guy who is really into bodybuilding that's when I was like oh and he way over he was trying to put on like so much muscle mass of his eating wavy on his fullness and trying to see why he I was kind of learning about that. Separate worlds with my first you know deep in the water was Fitness culture and it's such a disorder world that bodybuilding world yeah and even from then like he was there was no pressure I just remember seeing that and we just more of these like little experience is kind of like it unconsciously in your brain like oh that's what people buying a truck that what that's what we should be doing with our bodies or at our food but then like in in college I again I really still had a pretty normal relationship with food and then I don't know what happened I really have stayed on this since I decided being your podcast when did this happen like how did this happen I started Weight Watchers after my freshman year in college why who told me this and I don't know anybody but that was like my first real diet it was just me but now listening to other people tell their stories seems pretty common which is again awful and such a Gateway diet for a lot of people not experience was I think his college is a really can be a really hard time at least it was me I had so much fun but it was also super stressful academically and I think it was looking back now it's a way to cut like I have this under control you know what the the points or whatever their system was at the time I'm ever going to the meetings and people just looking at me like why you're here I'm still having this need to change my body wow so yeah it sounds like it was sort of just a weird flute that you ended up there like nobody told you to do it do you know what spurred that decision not really sure how I got a guided to go to Weight Watchers I just think I'm imagining I was going home with summer and I drove past there little building and all they have expired Weight Watchers and and I was into the gym too so I'm sure that was a big part of it actually that's a big part of it people in the gym cuz I worked at a gym in college in the Summers I go home and Nest Holyoke yeah probably so much but I heard it like people are doing all these different diets and must have heard it from somebody from there one of the you know people at the gym and it was just what I found it it was very much it gets you yeah it sucks you're right in start losing some weight and then it just kind of perpetuates and just kind of sucks you in it like working at a gym in college like how did you decide to do that and it sounds like Fitness culture there the fitness culture AKA diet culture under another guy's was very rampant and caused you to do some things to manipulate your body size and change your eating but I'm sure there was a lot of a lot of other stuff going on there too and terms of diet culture believe so what was that like and how did you kind of end up there in the first place the umbrella and that at that particular time was just eating less it was the motto and exercising more and I think the bodybuilding world that time was very much very clean eating popcorn and coke clean eating you know eating only particular Foods different times being at the gym it just kind of made me realize it was is less about manipulating my food was more about eating less at the time and then trying to work out to compensate if you don't follow your plan or something it wasn't really at that time for me to change my body to different ways like body composition how it kind of evolved for me as I got older so you are kind of sucked into the bodybuilding world that sounds like more after college has a Weight Watchers really was like my the beginning of that led to more of my eating disorder Behavior cuz I think after so long like I hear Ike so it seems so easy right your first diet and then it's like oh well I get this out points but what I can eat less points and it was very much I was only one who's doing it in my little world with my friend so it's just how to make my own little game a horrible game and then it just after so long you know why do restriction you know it doesn't last so much and Savannah and I think I was there Weight Watchers on off like a year or two and then it lets you like a full-blown eating disorder because it's just when that's why I think you like tomorrow I didn't realize it until now is more like the Restriction in and bought us objective compensatory behaviors after that yeah and that's that's such a common thing thing for a lot of people that start with the diet and Chase that high from the first diet and try to go lower and lower with the calories are the points or whatever it is and all that restriction just can't last and so it kind of spiraled into some sort of disordered Behavior whatever that is whatever that looks like for particular person associated with the restrict Gene and over exercising and different things like that I mean during that time it was only a short. Of time but going to doctors all the time and that's why I love like some people are really getting into the medical world and try to Advocate Health at every size and intuitive eating cuz I wish so much like all those doctor visits for years someone asked me know what are you eating how is your relationship like with your food how was your exercise and different things like that it's just so many times I feel like it's missed like I feel you on that that is exactly what I wish for myself when I was younger too oh yeah I was I had a very similar trajectory where I started out trying to lose weight that I had gained on the birth control pill and it had thin privilege and intuitive eating all up until I was 20 but I had you know of course grown-up and diet cultures I was hearing all these terrible things about people and larger bodies and was like thank God I don't have to deal with that you know that was sort of my attitude was just like what I can eat whatever I want and everybody tells me that because I'm thin but know if I ever gain weight or something I would have to do something about it I think this was my unconscious believe I didn't really ever articulated like that but looking back I can see that that's how I saw things and then when I was 20 and I gain weight from a birth control pill I was like oh my God it's happening I have to lose weight what do I do and I went down this like early internet Rabbit Hole of like searching her you know just like the worst terrible the ideas of only gotten worse as the internet has brown of course it's like but at the time it was like at Ken's and low carb and all this nonsense and so I kind of fell down that rabbit hole and then started having health problems because the Restriction as well and then went to all these doctors and was like why don't I have my period what's wrong with me is it could it be my thyroid which turns out I did end up having a thyroid condition Hashimoto's thyroiditis but like I was diagnosed with that later and there's some evidence that like I mean there's a lot of evidence of Eating Disorders can cause thyroid dysfunction causes right and also that they might even either trigger Hashimoto's or Serta masquerade as Hashimoto's but actually there's something going on with the body that makes the thyroid attack itself when you're starving and so you know it would have really been nice to know that and for people to say for doctors to say like hey it looks like something's up with your thyroid can we talk about like are you dieting are you eating enough are you exit are you over exercising like what's your relationship with food in your body like and instead it was like well your weights not too low so it couldn't be that you know and just dismissed out of hand the fact that my weight wasn't quote on quote to low mad that I couldn't possibly be doing anything with exercise or food that was problematic and same with like I started to siren medication and still didn't get my. Back and then it was like what could it be gluten I got on this whole train of thinking it gluten was the problem and that I was you know how does subclinical sensitivity or whatever and 1/2 doctors either be like well I don't really know why you're not having your period so yeah maybe it's gluten like try cutting it out and see if you feel better or just had them kind of throw up their hands and be like well I don't know what to do now we've got all the tests and everything seems fine so why are you having her. I'm not really sure you know and it was just incredibly frustrating and I know now seeing clients are going through the same thing how maddening that is as a person going through it to have doctors be like well I can't really tell you what's wrong but there's this huge missing piece but the doctors don't get and the person suffering doesn't get which is like you're doing some fucked up shit with your food and your exercise because of what you've been told by Daya culture because of these disorder believe that you've internalized and that's what's causing these complications and instead you got doctors now that are like what yeah probably is gluten why don't you try this low FODMAP thing why don't you cut out this this and this fully exacerbating the eating disorder or the disorder and not even recognizing it not even seeing that the person's relationship with food is sort of the missing link here it's just it's awful Agony and pain over those years and I can so empathize with that like going to the doctors and then not knowing and then even like after my eating disorder I'm done with that but because the diet culture perpetuated my other behaviors rise of I totally got into the air like some low carb and then it just even I wasn't doing eating disorder behaviors I was still in golf with diet behaviors when was so normalized I was still having all these health issues but then a doctor's and be like you're fine everything's fine testing everything and you're at a healthy weight range was all based on my weight and being mean I'm not looking deeper I mean not let me till I kind of working with a health coach and working with nature path to adjust station diets and I know I just getting into this health is on kind of framework like well I got to eat this way and then this will solve it all I think it's warm so much pain we're looking for something to help us feel better and if I think that's what diet cultures tries to sell the people to it's like won't be too small This way everything is going to be okay and whether it's for the size of your body or your health I feel like that culture finds a way to feed off that fear absolutely and so yeah how did that how did that play out for you then getting swept up into that house at some stuff I knew I come from all the diet I've done over the years I will cutting calories in over-exercising isn't really working that is at work so all my energy went towards trying to find the best diet right I love when you say that is the wife beef because man when you said that a few months ago I was like yeah it totally freaking is it's insane but you know I said I was like okay I want to look like that person I don't want to be not anymore I got to find out what they do so they found like a health and fitness coach who really she taught me in a way of eating that still just died cultures rules still working with the health coach and someone who comes from a very you have done a lot of work through this but and anxious temperaments perfectionist personality when I was told to follow certain plan to look like Chrome quote what was in that you have to eat this way and it was very much based on Lake paleo can Coke clean eating and macros in grams and it was so distracting but it was also a limit of eliminating food I mean you think about all that energy towards like what am I eating how much am I eating it's exhausting and from there I was still having time to stomach issues cuz no one really dealt with the stress of thinking about food all the time how it impacts her your overall body so should I even like went to a good nature path and nothing gets nature pathic man I think there could be some and I know if you have you on the podcast mention some wonderful nature path my experience with just feeding into my disordered behaviors I'll just cut out gluten cut out Dairy cut out so I do these cleanses and I wasn't feeling well and I was afraid to lose that Fitness no shape or whatever so I was like okay have to follow this way just be set of rules that you think's going to make you feel better but ultimately just created or isolation and more more pain and more stress and if Matt again if someone would have talked about the relationship with food and how its impact feeling I think that would have changed how my body was reacting to food and stuff oh yeah absolutely I fully identify with that too because I think the stress of disordered eating both physical and mental distress that puts on your body in the trauma that it is to the body to be restricted of food like that it creates digestive issues so you know and sometimes like the behavior is the disorder behaviors themselves are creating digestive issues sometimes it's what we think of is like quote on quote healthy eating but we're eating so many vegetables and so much fiber that it's causing like bloating and gas is converted like oh my God and then it's like I bet you're told like oh it must be this this and this are allergic to that you're sensitive to so cut them out and then your you end up eating more foods that high in fiber and so-called whole plant-based foods that exacerbate the problem even more and if people could just kind of take a step out of it and be like did I have any of these digestive issues before I went down this rabbit hole before I started the clean eating thing or the you know whatever it was I mean it's very hard to be objective about yourself like that about your experience you know but in hindsight I can fully see it for myself I didn't have any no significant stomach issues I certainly had like a nervous stomach and got anxiety stomach aches and stuff like that as a kid and everything but I didn't have any reactions to food or anything like that or chronic digestive issues as an intuitive eater and I was eating lots of so-called processed foods and like whatever and then when I went down the clean eating you know Proto early days of clean eating before it was even called that rabbit-hole I suddenly had all kinds of digestive issues and also was not eating enough Andover exercising and then binging at night and you know the occasional compensatory behaviors and stuff of course my digestive system was going to be totally screwed up and instead of looking at what I was doing before before I got into all this stuff I didn't have any of this and then it suddenly now I do like Occam's razor what's the change here that's the simple explanation for why all this is happening now but instead I was like oh no it must be gluten it must be there it must be so it must be blah blah blah blah blah you know instead of realizing like this is just a reaction to the way that I'm eating and an increasingly disordered empathize with all of that it's yeah if you don't know it when you're in it so caught up in the rules and then the fear of losing are breaking the rules and different things like that but when you're outside and can really absorb from a different angle it's kind of overwhelming like how quickly it can accept you in like I said before so overwhelming yeah and it sounds like you really got sucked in like that to where you weren't seeing also that the issue wasn't what you were eating or meeting to cut out more foods but the issue was like how you're really into food everybody I work with the health coach who was helping me quote unquote get fit and they're working with the nature path to work on my gut issues then it was like oh it's all came back like killing what the doctors had previously told me again not looking at the whole big picture of everything and now you're when you're in it you're just kind of like trying to put Band-Aids on the symptoms versus look me up from a holistic point of view yeah and a truly holistic point of view not the the fake holistic point of view that she knows some of those naturopaths in and alternative medicine practitioners do and of course there are good ones out there too but like I think the water down means conversion of holistic now is just like cut out these foods and you'll take care of yourself cut out these Foods for Health and that's not what holistic really is cut out things again it puts it just creates this hyper focus on the things that we can't have and then feeling so much shame if you do have that or isolation because you can't be around certain people or situations because phone call it's not clean or going to interfere with your plan yeah and that steals your life and that way to write cuz you're isolating yourself from the people that you care about and from situations that you could enjoy and not think about food 24/7 but instead it's food controls your life people who are supposed to be the one supposed to write doctors and nature pass and at that time to help cuz you look at them as they should know what they're doing there's a misconception of snowing at all and health coaches knowing at all and not like we're just people and losing touch losing touch with that's where I've been eating being able to we know what we need to eat but we're so scared because we fall out such external rules for so long that we lose that trust we lose the ability to know and be like we're going to be okay but my calls again feeds on the fear of not fitting in your culture based on our size or moral obligation towards health is a bad this is the way we have to eat that's the newest people are afraid of anything process which most Buddhist process that's very interesting how it's kind of evolved totally and these authorities outside authorities that's that claim to know what is best for us like you said they're just people like their they do have training and education and stuff but also their steeped in diet culture like the rest of us there Steve Dennis Hellfest rhetoric around you know what people should and shouldn't eat and Justice caught up and disordered thinking about food and to your point about IBS too I think that's so interesting that you had that reaction like well it's a medical diagnosis so it must be something I'm eating or I have to go get to the root of this and I think I see that a lot of people too and I know I had that when I was diagnosed with IBS as well and it's interesting cuz I be as a diagnosis of exclusion anything with the word syndrome in it basically is like you know is likely going to be some sort of diagnosis of exclusion where are you don't really know it doesn't have a mechanical basis it doesn't have a bye let you know there's no does nothing actually wrong with the digestive system right there's nothing you can see on an MRI or anything like that and there's no other. Disorder that has like a really strong clinical criteria that you would fit into your not fitting into like Crohn's disease or inflammatory bowel disease which is very different than IBS it's irritable bowel syndrome is like just a catch-all term for someone who doesn't fit into any other category or diagnosis that is actually much more clinically strong base it's like we know a lot more about Crohn's disease or celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease then we do about IBS like IBS is just like well you don't have any of those major things and there's nothing physically wrong with your gut so you're going to get thrown into this category of IBS for you have something going on you have symptoms in your gut for unknown reasons basically yeah we trust them and then weirdest when we're in pain we want people to give us a solution I think that's again where diet culture diets like make it so alluring and yet they still wet 99% * fail but yet we keep doing it because we want we want to not feel the pain every want the answers and we're told to not look inward to look out yeah and that's so, naturally I think in our culture to fall into that trap because also people who don't have we're not raised knowing how to trust our instincts SunTrust our inner wisdom especially people socializes women in this culture were raised and trained to like be nice and put aside your rage and put aside your reactions you know your anxiety about certain people and get along with everybody and go along with the program and don't make waves and so it just disconnects us from our inner wisdom that could be so useful and so many contacts including in our relationship with food in our bodies for sure so how did it go for you from there then how did this health coach situation and started to cut out all these Foods unfold for you at first ever died at first it was pretty easy and it felt like super empowering like I I can I'm on my way to fixing how that's been and I'm really looking the way I wanna with the fitness culture but then like any diet some point I was like do I always have to eat this quote on quote clean after like so long I was like really starting to question I can I do this forever do I want to do this forever and I remember like my 1 year wedding anniversary that was kind of like a holy crap I were talking to her back so can I have cake or glass of champagne and she's like oh no cuz that's processed and Emily were just being so like conflicted like I am scared to I got that why I was scared to eat I wouldn't consider like being at orthorexic you know cuz I'm still focused on changing my body but definitely had orthorexic behaviors like I just fearful of anything process because I've been told by all these people who are experts that Beast food bad so that kind of involved and then from there I got pregnant and that really was an experience would help me remember what it was like to be an intuitive eating there's like the first time I was I got my body physically told me you cannot eat anymore broccoli or otherwise you're going to get sick and I literally like my body refuses to eat anything Whole Food considered whole food and you can tell me where is Baskin Robbins Mexican Burrito King burritos it was it was awesome and it wasn't you know if he will sometimes Let It Go when you're pregnant I think it was my body is knowing what I know now it was my body is just way of trying to repeat itself to feed the my child and to really know what I want to trust it so that was a wonderful experience to have but then it still I still was endorse or eating after pregnancy cuz I think there's so much pressure for women to lose her baby weight right away and all that kind of stuff so it's still definitely swept up in the diet culture and fitness culture but I really think that experience plus my child help me move out of it quicker right cuz you had that sort of moment of like reconnecting with your intuitive eating from the past and being like right this is possible possible after pregnancy definitely was not ready to go back to the quote clean eating as I can I just can't just only eat vegetables and lean meats and yams and I love them now I can't do it anymore that led to many learning about really getting into the fitness world for a few years cuz again we always are there so many different diets for like this one though and so I learned about another way of counting calories but in a fitness world it is really big so thin this before and I told you I like initially was just about reducing her calories and exercising whatever and now if in his cultures more about like manipulating your Macros and eating it sell it sells the people right now because it's like you can eat all type of food to trap every freaking thing including your broccoli spells you can have Pop-Tarts and still be lean and so that was a part of the oh I know and the way I can help me move out of like the quote clean eating and to be able to have Foods I wanted but I guess it again it was like so controlled and knowing you're in its we don't realize how consuming it is and also to the fitness culture when you're in world just like any diet and feel like it's a sense of community and they're in the fitness cultural world it is even though I never did bodybuilding cuz I just cannot ever imagine getting doing that definitely trains and no nothing against people who do I just I personally like that and so it felt like all this is the one this is the one where you can see all the food you want and doesn't have new can eat Whole Foods or play foods and you'll still be fit right I do not know this was Mao Vistas at this isn't right and what is that I started even part-time business school counselor for 11 years but I went part-time when I had my daughter and again because I was so in a diet culture as I owe when I found that type of framework am I coming out to help other people do this I know it's horrible I feel so bad for the clients I work with but I feel like this was the way that people can eat all of the things that they want to and work out less like that was like my thing eat more work less and I feel like because of my previous eating disorder and start eating I thought this was we would be helpful for people because he's having to work out and you can eat so much more food but when I started working with clients found out like because I've been doing it so long and tracking my food and my Grands attic is seem easy for me but you forget how anxiety-provoking it is and how isolating it is when I started working with clients I just knew I couldn't do it anymore not very long at all cuz it just I can't keep doing it yeah what does it feel like to see people go through that if I could feel so much of their pain and so much of their anxiety and shame that I knew. I'm thinking I want to be helping people cuz I thought it help me but then during their struggle and curing like moms who you know how to take care of kids and have to go to work full time at the time I had Summers off so I see we have had more flexibility in the summer and working with clients students going to college at life as my stressful and for them to have to stop in like micromanage everything I was just seems so absurd to be having people do that and I hope of losing body fat wasn't a weight and losing body fat now my quote-unquote lean on their life so ignorant with me and then I was like so what do I do now it was not something I felt like obviously we all have our own experiences and I knew there was something I was always been so much of my life I know I want to be something with the helping that's a kind of mine I feel like my nature and so I thought this was a way that involve both of my you know my passions with at the time like Fitness in and food instead I thought that's the way it's funny but you know what I mean is I feel you on that too cuz I definitely was attracted to a career as a dietitian for the same disorder reasons like I can help people be healthy reverse the quote unquote obesity epidemic and we have to share our selves compassion at the check myself and you know we don't know until we know and I think the one thing I love about people sharing their journey is on your podcast even new disclosing so much is that being open like even now I would say this is where I am liking my beliefs and my core values and principles but I am still open like I am still things change as we learn and I think it's a part of human nature that we can't be like black and white that we have to have Ray and be open to listening to people's stories and being open to thinking critically to help kind of guy like where was our our purpose in the work we're doing and like what kind of life we want to have and in the present and in the Future 2 yeah that's so well said and it sounds like your experience as a therapist and school counselor has heard of informed that also like that wisdom and compassion for your clients when you were doing the fitness coaching how do you recognize like okay this is not this is not feeling good this is not feeling congruent with my values are my desire to help people and I think that's such a useful intuition to have as you move forward cuz I'm sure and I felt as an experienced this to wear like some things that I try to express or try to do to help people really didn't resonate or land with them and then I had to start to feel okay that doesn't feel good I feel like I'm out of alignment with my desire to help people when I'm delivering a message that is driving them in this in this weird reaction that I didn't intend and so how can I try to create a career in a life that is more congruent with my values and what would that look like and just kind of trying to keep pushing forward in that way so that as time goes on hopefully I'll just become more and more inclusive and able to truly help people and truly support people who want support on whatever their their journey is but it's yeah it's kind of a learning experience for all of us and especially when you're raised and diet culture and when we so many of us struggle ourselves and are attracted to the field because of that of course it's going to take us time to move out of it and to recognize like oh crap like that thing that I was doing back there was not helping people actually internally and integrating things that are important to us 10 and be able to to listen to that and honor it so that we can do the things that we think are valuable it look like for you then when you had that experience of recognizing like oh crap this is not helping the counting and tracking situation that I'm trying to teach people to do is actually causing them pain where did you from there is actually interesting so what I launch that service and other therapist I reached out and she was one who sold I heard it's awful license as a therapist counselor and I all I needed was my hours to be a therapist and I was like okay and I knew I stopped at coaching people I was like kind of open up the door like I know I want to help people and I feel like I'm onto something let me file explorer that and luckily I found a supervisor when I told her what I've been kind of doing what I was hoping I'd be like I want to help people not trying to lose weight all the time like I knew that's what I wanted I wanted people to feel accepting of their bodies I knew I was at that place at that time also when I started Kojak to stop tracking too but that's was a couple years ago now I was like I can't do this I didn't know what to do I need more anyways I found a supervisor and she telling her what I want to do it's to know what that would look like what it is I didn't she looked at me and she's like I want you to read Health at every size and intuitive eating and when I read those books it just so I know him for this on your progress for my mind was freaking blow and I was like what the hell this is been here the whole time I was like it was a resonated with it I guess you know back cuz I just didn't know for so long I mean what the evening and Saturday is probably 10 to 12 years of my life so I just be forget like people don't die it because you forget that you don't have to follow a plan and that you can eat foods that you want and connect with your body and that it's okay you know again it's not like you said not a hunger and fullness diet but it's very much like having the full permission without without trying to have a certain outcome what your body would look like if it just totally so different from what I thought for so many years but felt so familiar yeah so you kind of remember that from from childhood probably and maybe from your pregnancy experience as well I said that this is what I have to do and from then it was funny I was looking at 10 I mean literally I like the diet that geyser life be like literally I've been a school counselor and I feel like I love working to school but to be honest primarily my energy at the school was like when I started and then when I left but after the work hours it was so focused on Fitness and food and all those things but when I found into dating and health at every size and knew that was what I want to put my energy towards and that's what I actually found your podcast couple years ago and that really help me steer the way I like learning like I need to learn more about this and that led me to do in the intuitive eating certification and then also eating disorder program at Lewis and Clark so I just kind of like as soon as I was I think cuz of like my story I was once I heard about this movement heard about honoring what your body is telling you I was all-in I was off obviously with anybody at least in my experience like eating outside support was super helpful and working with a therapist on my cuz it's all those years of dying it's really hard to kind of reject that and look at it from another angle yeah there's so much Nuance to it I totally had that experience myself for like I read the book intuitive eating it totally clicked I was like this is what I've already I already did as a kid to be able to like be peaceful with food and it makes so much sense and this is what I need to do it again but then the actual practice of letting go of all the dieting behaviors and thoughts and the little vestiges of the diet mentality that are still hanging on and not getting sucked back into diet culture and all the sneaky ways like that's what I think requires so much additional support and just like reinforcement it's so important to I think it's a therapist as a diet send our health coach to do the work yourself so that you can be fully present when your clients may be going through some more things are different experiences to be able to be so attuned with your client and knowing that you've gone through similar things and to be able to show empathy and to really be present for the pain that takes to kind of give up dieting and to recreate a relationship with your own body and food and and knowing them big ones that comes up with letting go of that thing we've done for so long yeah cuz it is ambivalent like even though it can be so inspiring to find a new way in to be like yes I want this it's tough to give up those long-standing behaviors and habits because they really become habits and it's like you can be all inspired to be an intuitive eater and embrace the principles of Health at every size but then you're like oh shit what do I eat for lunch you know I get to his day-to-day decisions that are early child learning how to draw if you think you said before I drive in car I like I like Thai my clients which I think I have to come with a new analogy a lot of people drive a stick shift I like that statistics terminology it's like when you get in the car I got to push in the Clutch & Go in first gear and then sometimes we're going to stall and have to get back go back into first gear and then pushing her collection back and be very exhausting for clients to to have to like initially pay so much attention to it cuz all they're wanting us to not for the most part but once you can reconnect I feel like that that healing can begin and then we can start doing the other work right and it does become easier over time I think that's one of the things that can give people some help because it does feel so hard at the beginning you have to think about every aspect you have to be like okay push the clutch move the thing like or my I often say like you know when your first driving even but I can tell you're like holding the wheel and you're like hey hands at 10 and 2 and like signal on check the rear view mirror check the side view mirror check the blind spot and it's like you have to think about it so much but then once you get I want to click in with it and you're just like driving down the highway talking to someone and listening to a podcast and changing lanes like it's no big deal I also want to mention like the work that I have my own practice and I'm working with clients like I'm still working at the school I don't see kids and my private practice yet cuz I felt two and four year old at home and I don't know how many little kids I can be around all the time but I do I'm grateful for finding an intuitive eating and health at every size and all these wonderful people I work with because it has helped me have a different lens and how when talking to kids and how I hear them speak about their bodies and their relationship food and how it is I work at elementary school I think it is super prevalent to have these discussions at a younger age that I'm realizing like I didn't have that so I would never thought about that now but as we evolve and learn I can really hear the stuff and now it's really amazing to be able to have those conversations in a school and with parents and potentially a larger mass of the school districts yeah that must be so interesting and what are you seeing like in kids at that age in terms of diet culture and distorted beliefs about food that show up I'd imagine sincere and kind of a progressive area right like the Portland area there's probably a lot of that clean eating vs flying around North I live in Portland but my business in the schools in Vancouver but still all very the same it is very much so it's now it's hearing so many so many requests that has been gluten-free and dairy-free and sugar-free and like every other three are so much help ISM in the schools but from accounting point of view I mean that there's just been more situations especially in the last year why are my ears are kind of like you got on fire during conversations like I go in the cafeteria in the morning with the kids and I'm sitting with a bunch of 5 and 6 year olds and a girls talk about how she love something she's eating and she's like I can't eat this all the time I go how come she's like well I don't want to get fat and I don't mean that in like and negative way it's just that it's just her experience and we're talkin am I calling you no more wood chips lessons all bodies are theres people who are tallest people who are larger than people who are different color they trying to like normal I was just like yeah but I still don't want to be like that it is a 5 year old and I also do a history of friendship and friendship skills and all of a sudden they start poking at their stomachs and putting their bodies that I have gained weight or I weighed myself and I've lost weight but I don't want to gain it back and I'm like oh my gosh like these are 9 year old girls girls in smaller bodies and there's other girls and larger Bisons you could see how it affects all of them you know but a specially the girls and I could see the shame and like I don't want to talk about this stuff so I think that it's something we don't really pay attention to or we just kind of like oh they're just elementary kids but I think more my so it's it's starting at a younger age because the students are hearing it from their parents and no judgement to parents because that's what they grow if it's were all and I called her right and I've no judgment towards that but the messages we I really didn't even if it's like there's so much more to learn from our body language or facial expressions actually the word we say so we can say oh it's okay to eat that food and then when we don't eat it ourselves or you like grab our stomach on being so bad or those subliminal messages really impact those kids cuz they're so aware of those non verbal comments or motions all that kind of stuff if that makes sense ohmygod totally yeah kids pick up so much they're like little sponges and they're going to write what they hear their parents saying and older kids and other siblings and stuff saying so yeah I think that's how diet culture gets disseminated it's really been a short time and it's existed in the grand scheme of things it's only like a hundred fifty years but that's several Generations that were instilled you know inculcated in it and then passed it down to their kids and then those it's passed down to their kids and so on and it's like every generation it just gets more entrenched and you know it becomes a sort of psychological thing instead of just a socio-cultural thing because now it's coming from your family of origin then of course it's going to feel so important and real when that message is coming from your parents as a kid as we all know all to a kids they're so influenced by what we say especially cuz I mean I can say the same thing to a child that their parents do but they're more likely to listen to me sometimes I think that's very, sometimes you don't want to believe everything your parents say but I can say the same thing and teachers like there with the kids more than their parents are in the school year and I really try to pay attention to January when so many teachers were on their diet during Weight Watchers or the new keto and all these different diets and I could watch it I just wanted to observe you know cuz I've been there too and I again no judgment but want to watch like teachers are coming Jen it was so excited they're so excited about the new diet they're all talking about the lunch room and the kids are hearing it like I'm on a diet and their hearing I need to lose weight their hearing that my body said okay I'll ranches right cuz it affects everybody I have cheaters who are in a really small bodies and teachers are in larger bodies and their hearing women and really smaller by his back on God I'm so grossed all that kind of stuff but then it kind of Cycles to when give it a month I mean a week even when the diets ultimately don't work then I see the mood change and teachers and this is not like to be like it's all teachers falderal parents but I'm just saying it's something that we need to do something more about by educating that language how it just I have such a negative impact on our students because when they're cut they're super upset they're feeling shame because they've died didn't work and then they come to school and they're like right away so bad about ourselves and most people are either going to I call either go I say bye so I teach kids and teachers might respond that way because the diet going to work or going to this hyperarousal like this I call if the rez don't like more irritated like they're not feeding themselves when they're coming off or maybe because they started benching and then there on the planet again so I think that all full circle affects not only the interpretation of what is the best way to eat for kids really need to lose weight but also the energy in the classroom and took the kids to get the best experience when are at school I think a dieting really impact call teachers are feeling about themselves and taking care of their body and feeding it nursing and a way that they can be them Estelle's because that's a lot of work in elementary school 25 kids I could never do it I might be a teacher like they are amazing they are so amazing but we could be even more amazing if we took care about is better and you're not so focus on trying to change it so we can really be present with the students and ourselves so well. Such an important point cuz diet culture that's another way in which it's the life Thief you know it steals your ability to be present with people and be a good role model for kids in your life or do your job effectively and really enjoy your job and be in it and is supposed to find of having your wheel spinning on something else and feeling bad about yourself all the time and like that is another way in which what culture just gets transmitted to kids I can totally remember hearing adults in my life including teacher saying negative things about their bodies are talking about diets and that was part of what built the framework of the House of diet culture that then was able to cannoli down the path of disordered eating later and it's only gotten worse now or another podcast it's well now it's like I'm not dieting I'm just trying to be healthy and I'm just cutting out all the bat hear all the bad food cuz I am or care about my health but there's a totally the wait is so there with it but we can use this health word as a way to not make the the weight loss the number one drive to do things but it's still there yeah it's a subtle undercurrent it's like people of course still want to lose weight and that's supposed to be a side effect of just quote unquote getting hell but it's still part of the promise of any of these healthiest kind of approaches to food I'm going to eat really good this weekend or I'm being so bad because my office like I always have candy at all different types of food in there in like I'm being so bad and I tried like 3 educate them on that have different kind of conversation obviously I have to talk to parents in a school setting but just gives me another opportunity to put a little tight a little C I feel like that's great that's really important to be able to do that and like you're in such a good position I bet in being able to work in the school sister to be on the front lines of that stuff and help make a change in people's lives when I think diet culture is just so Insidious that people don't see it and they don't notice how much it harms their kids how much harms them and so to have you there just being able to be like you know foods are good or bad and actually you're not being bad when you eat this you're just enjoying yourself and pleasure is a normal part of any relationship with food and that's a good thing you know I was like I'm sure that's blow some kids mines in a really good way some of the kids I work there like yeah that's kind of messed up to that little switch just even if it's something like a little critical thought like that I don't have to think this way oh at my body is okay the way it is it's really rewarding I mean I thought about even come super passionate about this work and I mean that's why I started the practice but they haven't thought about it people ask me like are you going to leave the schools and just do solo private practice and where I am right now I'm with my kids but it's I feel like the reason I got into the schools is because you can be it was for prevention and to be proactive and especially with everything that's how opening in our society and how it's just feel like it's gotten so much worse I feel like there needs to be some people in the school to say it's not okay that one they're showing certain presentation done eating a certain way of to stay that's actually not okay and kind of have those conversations that may be difficult but also I feel like extremely important I feel like the more people we can get to talk to the schools am I hope would be to limit the number of students boys girls all genders from feeling like their body is not good enough based on cultural standards this is I think really important so that's awesome and yeah I think that's such a good Mission because I wish every school had somebody at least one person but hopefully I definitely know a lot of people listening to the podcast and people in my two of eating course and stuff are teachers like I've worked with a number of teachers also private clients to so like I think I think that like people in the helping professions generally which I would include teachers in that like I think and school counselors and stuff to you like I think folks in that Arena just have some curiosity and desire to help people that often does lead them to the sort of intuition that you had where it was like I can tell that this is not helping people when I'm giving them these tracking assignments or whatever like what can I do differently like yeah and I think there's a certain self-awareness that comes with being a helping person or you do notice those things and you're like okay well clearly that didn't work like what is going to work and so I think the more teachers and you know people in the schools that can come to this field in this Arena and do some work to advocate for intuitive eating and health at every size model instead of the bullshit like BMI report cards and good and bad food discussions where of certain foods are demonized and others are elevated and just put a voice of reason in the mix and maybe even make some change at the policy level whether that's a school district-wide thing whether that's just what the individual school where the way that they're teaching nutrition and movement and stuff is coming from whoever is setting that curriculum like if you can get involved in that level and start to make change their like I think that's where some real magic will happen we can just take away some of that poisonous language and rhetoric around bodies people in the education they are in the helping profession like I don't know if I've met any teacher or person his work in the school district who doesn't want to help improve family situations or help their students in if they knew it was causing harm that I know they wouldn't do it you know I think that's just the point of you like you're saying I talking to the bigger system the school-wide and all those different things to hopefully create change that's what I met with the school district and were me and a couple of days petition the great Julie Bowman and Catherine Jeffcoat in Portland there's so many amazing therapist Rd is here in this moment I can't even wrap my head around and I'm so fortunate I mean working with some great wonderful supervisors but we are going to be hopefully meeting with like being Vancouver School District and Evergreen School District trying to get like nurses PE teachers and we have to get them to come because there's a lot of other options for them but I really am hoping that we can kind of plant seeds and like I listen to one of your podcast and I appreciate it I don't know who she when she was talking about your debate and she was saying less about the statistics and more about connecting with people's experiences and I was Elizabeth Scott I really love that episode to think about all the statistics on Health at every size and weight stigma but I see how it is just really impacts everybody but I think one thing I took from that is really making sure when I'm speaking to we are speaking to all of these Educators that relating to their experience and if they know the pain I've gone through that they're not going to want to do that to the students that they influence so much yeah connecting it to real people into stories and empathy instead of spouting off science and numbers cuz you know even with people who care about that stuff it doesn't really guess at the heart of the matter which is that it is the effect on people so I'm hoping that will be another foot in the door to have people think differently about dieting in the language that we stay around you know the students and also how they speak to themselves and their family it's just not something I think it's really grown like our moment I feel like I'm just around people all the time like this is how it is what we forgot I forget I get my bubble that it's still so big out there and so that's why I'm like so grateful for your pie cast cuz with two little kids and where I am in my career like I don't have the space or the ability to do a lot of the work that so many people are doing like you and Taylor from being harassed at all I mean all these people who are really speaking out and advocating for this is social justice being so I feel like this is my like one little piece it all of us do something and take apart in some way it's going to spread to more people and I say really feel like it is growing absolutely and yeah we all have our ways of helping like we all have our talents in our gifts that we can bring to this movement and like what you're doing is so amazing you know I like I don't have access to that system like you do and so the fact that you and those dietitians can like go in there and speak to the folks who are a have the power to really influence kids in the school system and could make a really positive difference are really negative different kids lives like the fact that you can speak to them I think it's so amazing so I think yeah we're all doing our part but that's so cool what you're doing and I feel like your kids in your school system are lucky to have you thanks so much I mean I feel like it's a great opportunity and it's a really nice balance be able to speak to all of the Educators and also working with kids my private practice it's feels like it's a really nice balance yeah totally it's like me and all the all the different needs speaking of which tells about your private practice and how people can learn more about that and where the hell yeah sorry I have a private practice actually in Vancouver Washington it's north of Portland does not too far few miles up and then I can speak online in Washington and Oregon and I'm currently in the process of getting my license in Idaho so I can see clients on that line there too I only see a handful of clients and so when I get to it's something definitely doesn't feel like work it's something that I'm very passionate about and I love having that isn't a school it's so so busy it's really limited to have such a connected experience for a longer. Of time so to have that space is really rewarding it so yeah that's it it's in Vancouver it's awesome you can find me on Instagram and Facebook and Twitter I'm not haven't been on a 10 by plan to be on it more you can find me there I have my website is Christine Yoshida.
