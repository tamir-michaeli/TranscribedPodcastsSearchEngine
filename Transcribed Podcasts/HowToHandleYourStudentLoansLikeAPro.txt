of him on yachts and shit and he's got a lot of face tattoos he just got new ones under his eyes that say it says I think it says I'm always tired under his eyes like he's got it tattooed permanently one of my favorite beers is really good German ale at actually it's just it's a really just a good drink a little beer that's one of my favorites what about you what let me see it looks like the camera cuz Amber side anyway I am drinking a beer haven't opened it yet it's called Vincent Van couch 13 Brewing here in Colorado at the house here in Colorado and if you have a like are liquor stores

is very very good and if you like trap music Hip Hop Sing Song type type of stuff you like it anyway moving on if you want to know assholes this morning on Facebook by visiting list of money matters.com Community to send in new catch phrases for the show and I'm pretty sure we need some catchphrases because hey we got to do this every week so that's how that's how bottom-of-the-barrel we're scraping I hear okay and I want to introduce Travis Hornsby from student loan planner Travis how are you today and what are you drinking I'm doing great and I'm screwing up the party because I'm drinking coconut beverage from Trader Joe's so sorry you know can't can't really drink before noon you know screwed somewhere well it's Pikewood beer mean let's not let you know all the Good Ol fashion Colorado Spring Water you seem to be the student loan expert know what you call yourself a student loan expert you're wearing a shirt that says student loan planner that's the name of your website as soon will planet.com advised over a thousand people about 200 something million to 50 million of student debt just myself and teams more than that so I've seen everything from people living living somewhere else like playing the country to get away from their student debt to people in their life oh yeah die at you still haven't said you would get passed down and if you died no I mean like so so I actually have some people that email me that are suicidal because of their student loan debt that's really terrible like it yeah I'm in very sad like it ranges from like the good stories were people are paying it down fast and get out of that and it's just like this awesome educational decision they made to the depressing ones to people who are hopeless and into the fun ones are the people who figured out the strategy of you marrying the Australian boyfriend and going to let you know will they living together a New Zealand not having to pay any student loans in the u.s. yeah yeah so I'll see switch you just find an eligible bachelor in Australia and yeah we'll just Just for kicks like I'll just explain how it works thousand of dead right to say I say Andrew went to veterinary school or something and so he meets meets an Aussie and they moved together to Australia so how old is an awesome man have to be well yeah well yeah you have to basically just make sure that you're living and living in Australia that's the main thing you don't have to marry someone I brought you just going to have to figure out a way to stay there so you're there and so say you're making 70 $80,000 so there's something called the foreign earned income exclusion for you can take that incoming excluded from your US taxes and so then you could use your tax return in the US and have a $0 income and then you can certify your income-driven repayment options with a $0 income and get a $0 monthly payment presuming that most all of your student debt is on the federal system and then essentially postpone paying your debt til Infinity yes and so you put it off for 20 to 25 years right and then what you could do is missing the consolidation rules are the same in 25 years you could Consolidated again and get another 25 years and then if you die it's wiped away tax-free you know if you don't you have to pay income tax but are they going to be able to get income tax from you if your life is in Australia probably not so that's that's one of the real extreme siderius in the Middle East like that are doing that to pay back their state of dead people that are in Europe than just a little bit of everything I've had one person email me the other day they're like thanks so much for your advice I decided to get out of my life dental practice and move to like this Northern Indian reservation in like Canada in the woods and we built the cabin together with with my husband and it's the best decision I've ever made and I'm getting loan forgiveness because of my God I'm standing yeah kind of like that except you know what more debt than you know three mortgages but you know like so what what qualifies you did you did you have massive student loan debt at one point and sort of and found some sort of secret and then turn it into a business like what was your what's your story there so yeah so I was I was kind of living a lie if I was a bond Trader in the Northeast and paper that you being like that and she was in training an inch a lot of med school loans spreadsheet to model everything but then I found Public service loan forgiveness there's refinancing there's these programs or you can pay based on your income instead of just paying it back straight up and so is way more complicated than I thought and so I made this this Excel spreadsheet and he's like hey this is really good you should talk to my friends and so we were in a big city lot of people with you know why they weren't professional school programs so I started helping some of our friends were veterinarians and then some friends over Dennis and kind of snowballed and then I was like wow this is a heck of a lot more fun and make him like rich people leave richer so I'm just going to do this full-time and then kind of snowballed and you turn around the team together is about 340 million of student debt the past couple years wow best that's so much money that's just so much money it's not real though Smiley money right right so I have a pretty low there are first question that we have like it's pretty large when it comes to paying off student loans like I mean like look I don't I never have student loans after you've had student loans right no never that why my mom and dad were awesome maybe I said 503b or something you know whatever whatever it is I don't even know you don't even care that's the sad part of it to his like it you know you spend all this money and a lot of people to end up not even using the degree is your wife do that she she practice medicine all right so we have a question I think this came from our community and her is that true yeah yeah should I invest or pay off debt or can I do blow you know so a lot of people they want to start investing but they also have student loans and you know there's there's not a student loans I mean YouTube kind of give me the run down here but from my understanding student loans interest rates are lower than what they could possibly make doing investing so I mean what do you think about that well it's so depends but the rundown so we know if you have yeah if you have like private student loans at a greater than 7% interest rate you know you should absolutely prioritize that I think you know kind of the waterfall is like you start with getting your 401k match cuz that's like a hundred percent return that's the best you'll ever do right that you're so yeah you do that and then you make sure you got an emergency fund so you've got 10 grand in the bank no credit card debts can like the Baseline like I kind of am very uncomfortable telling people to pay on debt or invest in + did they at least do in their 401K match don't have credit card debt you know they got the 10K in money in the bank so assuming assuming that you're there and you have some extra funds to use what do you use it on so I'd like the price student loans that stuff toxic if it's over like I said higher interest rate so you should definitely get rid of that but so the problem with the question is like some people have debt that they should pay down some people have that they shouldn't so I'll give an example you know like you'll see articles online like how I paid you know $30,000 is it off with my like eight side hustles and 4 months yeah so that's like a typical undergrad story you know and I have a 98004 years after me like the good stuff that's like less than 1 times your income but the stuff that's not One X your income maybe you would take longer to pay that off and so then actually paying back debt can actually be a very bad decision and you should invest exclusively so hold on what do you mean about this one time is your income then yeah okay so so like if your undergrad right and I'll can I do like fifty thousand foot you if you're an undergraduate you can't be I'm more than certain amount of money cuz it's capped like so that's why you hear most undergrads coming out with like 30 40 50 thousand of student loans because you aren't going to like you know in why you coming out with to Grant the parents take out a limited loans under the parent plus program so for undergrad the most of the people that are screwed or typically parents not the actual people so you can have Mom and Dad like and I've had this so I can be ready to retire but oh by the way they had like triplets and they borrowed you know a hundred grand for each one of them to go to private Catholic school and so they don't 300,000 and they're like trying to live on Social Security and you can get unlimited debt in your own name so if you want to go to med school dental school law school something like that then you can borrow as literally as much as you want there's no cap that except for like the cost of attending which is like what the heck is that like the people who have the six figured that loads are typically these poor people that went to professional schools and the people who just have undergrad student loan debt those are the ones there you know like Yo Side hustling their way out of it writing you know Bisley blog post about the store right by me I guess the Assumption there is if you're going to go to med school right and you have $200,000 in student loan debt if you're making $200,000 a year you know coming out right when I have friends that went to med school they came out making bank really you know like I like working as a doctor or something yeah well here's the problem with that though so you could come if you go to a public med school that's in state maybe you'll leave with 150 or 200 Brea but if you go to a private med school somewhere in a high cost of living area where we know Rittz like three thousand a month or something then you can come out with 400 450 or 500 thousand even and so like med school like that could mean like a dead of anywhere for my cutter 50 to $500,000 and also being a being a position for things to write so like I could be a pediatrician make him you know 1:50 or I could be an orthopedic surgeon make in like five hundred grand and so you could really within one profession you can have people that owe you a modest amount relative to their income they can easily pay it off once they become you know attending physicians and you have people there like how the heck do I afford like a mortgage how do I have kids like how do I paper towels those kind of things I think who went to a private college in New Jersey and and came out and not not as an undergrad what time is it in undergrad me in the first four years right okay you can try to go to college you know and I'm like that's a lot that's a lot of money for just like a regular degree I think I mean most of my friends have like 30-40 $50,000 a debt are most of your clients that sort of the under the post-grad people will it cost a hundred people what are a let's let's here's what I want to do take us through an example client you know I want to know what you recommend I know there's different scenario depending on their life situation but I'm sure you have like an average story that you could tell of of somebody going through maybe they're $100,000 let's say between 100000 to $1,000 in student loan debt like what do you usually a bicycle to do so I'll give one example so say somebody's working for a not-for-profit or the government right so they go to keep the med school example we can use a different one but they go to bed school they're doing their residency for 4 years so during their residency they can pay maybe like $500 a month because they're paying based off of their income there's a bunch of different income based repayment plans there's three major ones it's called ibr revised pay as you earn and pay as you earn those are the three big ones he picked the right plan their you limit the payments during your training your come here so maybe like 500 a month and then the payments go up to like basically like maybe like 1500 month once you're making bank and if you look at the actual payments you might have paid like 80,000 and then went when you're you've done 10 years of service at a not-for-profit or government employer and you work full time that you could still owe maybe like a hundred thousand left over because you know the interest not touching the principal balance how much the government would forgive that hundred thousand dollars tax free okay right so that's one example so if this person is trying to minimize their payments that $80,000 a heck of a lot that can be done to try to figure out how to get those $80,000 of payments lowered okay so make sure I understand so you're going to pick a income-based repayment plan to lower the amount you pay per month and you're saying whatever with all the extra interest that builds up because you will go into a specific profession or it almost doesn't matter like if your medical it it's kind of like public service and he gets forgiven yeah what sucks I did it so it depends so if you're working for nonprofit or government employer then that Public service loan forgiveness program can forgive a large portion of that debt and said I just like one example like if you have $20,000 of debt you know you're working for the government or not for profit making like 60 70 K yeah that's not going to really apply to you right you're you're going to pay that phone bill it's off in 10 years it's your knocking have anything left but for people who owe that you know the 80220 hundred fifty thousand dollars of the world that are working and not for profits you can kind of really do some amazing stuff and cause the projected one forgiveness the government's going to pay for you to be the vast majority of your ballots and so there's a lot of people actually like one estimate said that a quarter of the entire Workforce in America could qualify for this that's a huge number of people yeah I don't know about it right well yeah it's been around for a few years and so you know it's a greater now right phone plan and that and so I had example give you an example of this pharmacist buddy of mine we went to college together if he had 200,000 of student loans he was working at it at a community you know Pharmacy Center since I was a qualifying not-for-profit to Grand a month on his loans I showed him that on the device pay as you earn plan he could be paying $700 a month that is loans and then that amount of money would be forgiven in 10 years at the end of it so instead of paying is loans off over 10 years for like 2 Grand a month payments he could be paying 700 a month and get like one forgiveness and like a hundred fifty Grand and what I understand he's your buddy who's a pharmacist like is he working for the or is he working for the government or nonprofit and not-for-profit government and then he heard that and I said and then you can take that 1300 a month different so you can max out your your 401k and then actually that will cause your taxable income to be lower and upper it's income-based repayment so then that causes them to save like another 20 grand and he's like bro I'm buying you beer that's it how do you buy me $100,000 Tesla that you don't have to pay that is but that's really only for you know people out of college to go work for a not-for-profit or a government job and does that qualify to people who even are just an undergrad that they just get there you know their bachelor's degree it's and it's not consecutive it can be cumulative but but but still out yeah but he did your life and you went to work at a private-sector job right yeah yeah let's let's let's say like a lawyer a lawyer make making like $70,000 a year and they've got 250 g of death from going to kind of like a mid-tier law school right seems like a really popular example the media loves to talk about just cuz of the law schools like Crisis in a legal job market so this person thing is is could never afford to pay like $2,500 a month to pay this thing off right that's that's it have to pay over 10 years paid off that's like half of their income after taxes yeah so so what they would do is there something called the pay as you earn program where they could pay maybe $400 a month and they could do that for 20 years and at the end of those 20 years because they were not covering the interest payments that 250,000 has grown to 400,000 and then the way that the rules work that you work in the private sector if you're not getting you no qualifying for Public service loan forgiveness than that $400,000 is taxable income that's a bonus and you have to pay taxes in the year of forgiveness all at once so $400,000 would be taxed at maybe like a 40% tax rate and so he would have to write a check to the IRS all at once 460 Grande I want to unpack that real quick in the previous two examples they worked need a public service or are for the government this this guy is a lawyer and Rising farm so why is he getting any forgiveness for so this is the kind of forgiveness that applies to literally anybody no matter what you're doing about forgiveness to your that anyone can qualify for you could be working part-time you could be like living in Australia like the thing I've mentioned earlier this is this is this is basically you're paying base or an income-driven option one of the one of the different plans and you're doing it for 20 to 25 years this time who all these plans by the government nation in 2010 pretty much anybody graduating from professional schools or undergrad these days has loans they're almost entirely originated from the federal government okay if you have been out of school for 20 to 25 years regardless of what you're doing with your life working not working private government you likely qualify to get your student loans forgiven so in other words that you owe hundred fifty thousand your income is below hundred thousand than the strategy could work out pretty good for you if you owe more than that and you work in the private sector then probably private refinancing might be so if you say old 30 and you decided that your profession was going to be a stay-at-home mom but didn't learn anything you can qualify for almost any forgiveness will you you could accept if you're married then that income from your partner would count cuz it household household income for a year you switch to domestic partnership and you travel the world you don't both of you don't make any money for 25 years that actually decided to divorce because their student loans and become a domestic partnership instead so we realize who it was based on his earnings that made sense also to essentially become like a domestic partnership because I need to get married in later right this is just like Omegle their plan is to reconcile after the loan forgiveness you know that that's a brilliant idea honestly yeah it's like pride of like stupid legal status is preventing from saving tens of thousands of dollars about 20 grand per year that it was causing him to be married so I'm sorry I'm just like I'm unpacking that okay so now to go back to the end of your example what you said it was 2000 the student loan debt and so what you're saying is if you personal everyone qualifies for a gift for forgiveness and if you do pull the trigger and take forgiveness the amount that is Forgiven is like a tax is like taxable income from the government is the government paying it off for you at the end of the 20 years or 25 years depending on what playing get used so that the other reality here is this guy could you $400 a month for the for the payments and then he's got the hundred sixty grand tax bomb that he's going to owe in 20 years will that something that you can use like a discount rate to figure out what amount you would need to save every month to be able to have a hundred sixty Grand to write a check to the IRS with so they so yeah maybe a better way to look at is not that it's like completely forgiven but you do take 400,000 and you reduce 200000 you still owe some example person does really well at their private law firm in the growth and they're making you know half a million a year then that then that doesn't he doesn't qualify anymore. So that he gets on a plane that has interest subsidies that slash is his effective interest rate while he's poor and then when he becomes rich okay then you can refinance and try to get a lower interest rate and just pay it back with one Fell Swoop cuz he's Ballers rich now you know but so what's crazy about this scenario is so to have that hundred sixty Grand like the average American doesn't even have five grand in the bank right so to have that hundred sixty Grand he's got to put like $500 a month away in a betterment account or something like that but what's crazy about this is like Steel on Jets 1.5 trillion and 10 years ago was like 300 billion so it's like quintuple over a very short amount of time and most people have these ones that aren't qualifying for this Public service loan forgiveness plan and so most people that have really high debt burdens are going to have these giant text Mom's there they are going to owe when their loans are forgiven and what do you think's going to happen when all these people get you no 150 Grand like Bill from the IRS in the mail your are they going to bankrupt play oh yeah and so instead of like a tax settlement dead or something with the IRS is dealing with midi you know if you hunt Neo few thousands of people tens of thousands now they're going to have millions of people that are going to have to make payment plans with the IRS what is that going to do the country I have no idea well here's the thing this is really freaking me out I need to go take a break cuz he got my nerves when I think about the future of our country and and and I just everyone knowing all these student loans it's it's scary be honest and I will be right back and we can talk more about this so it's no surprise Andrew that you run an online business I mean he were doing a podcast but you actually have a website listing money matters.com and I'm assuming assuming a lot of traffic from Google am I am I wrong in assuming that it is like 90 to 95% of our traffic okay well how do you know what to write and how do you know where your ranking and like how do you get traffic through Google so year one and two it was a crapshoot chili was random and unsurprisingly did not work out well and then we Thomas Tool a href s s I caught a giraffe's essentially a big data research tool for links so what is linked to what other links keyword research I mean that the breath of data available is insane and Laura and I have built multiple businesses in addition to listen Money Matters literally focusing on voids in the internet like things that people are looking for that don't exist to find them but I called them content gaps and so does a dress and it's actually an entire tool within a traps where you can look at other websites compare them to yourself and find the content gaps in between them to find you know what their ranking for in your not and vice-versa which I love and if you're out there and you want to build a business like Andrew you want to build a sweet ass business like losing money matters.com that is completely automated on income when you want to get traffic to that website guess what you say traps but here's the here's the thing you can actually get a free light annual subscription from HRS and all you have to do is get on Twitter and tweet at a giraffe sat at a href s and you have to tweet at Money Matters man to tell us why you want to win this hrsaccount also if you didn't catch any of this somehow you were driving you forget whatever don't worry all of this is going to be in the show notes for this episode so go ahead and visit H raps.com and let's get started with building traffic to your website hey Andrew hi hi did you know that the right hire to make a huge impact on your business yeah I strongly believe that yeah but you know if I did the right person is actually hard do you have to do you know where to find the right person not really I mean Myspace really well this if you can try posting on job boards but you really can't be sure the right person is going to see it right I mean yeah job Boards out there instead you can find the right person who will help you grow your business with none other than can you guess what it is MySpace know it's late there oh yeah that makes sense as the world's largest Professional Network people go to LinkedIn everyday to grow professionally I discover new job opportunities and 70% of the workforce the US Workforce is already on LinkedIn LinkedIn jobs matches people to your role based on more of who they are their skills their interest and how open they are to New Opportunities this way your job get seen by more of the right people now was it most LinkedIn members haven't recently visited the top job boards but 9 out of 10 members are open to New Opportunities so you can only reach them where buy LinkedIn I mean I get messages on there all the time and I honestly read them all even if I'm not looking cuz it's just really interesting totally and that's why you'll not you're not going to believe this cuz it's it's really like kind of out of this data stuff your dad in there do you love is a new hire is made every 10 seconds on LinkedIn wow business is rate LinkedIn 40% higher than job boards at the living quality candidates. Com matters and get 50% off your first job post that's linkedin.com matters and get $50 off your first job post linkedin.com matter temperature like alright we're back let's do this thing okay so let's move on to assume that people don't you know they're going to be want to pay it off fast on their own they want to pay the whole thing maybe they're not maybe it's only 80 grantor or even a hundred grand but they want to do it quickly what's the scenario there whether they're just like me they want to wait 20 25 years they're working a private job like what you do they want to do that that that success story of paying $100,000 off in 4 years what's it what do you tell people to do in that scenario or brain surgery not talking about private student loans in general like if you were doing yoga mat loans it's probably also at a high interest rate like six seven eight percent and that is you know if your plan is to pay this thing back in 4 years then your credit risk is way better than what your interest rate that's right so if you could pay it and what do you mean if the government sets the interest rate for everyone's loans or private lenders are going to charge you a bunch of loans for their bunch of interest for taking you out there alone while you're in school and so when you graduate and get a job when when mortgages or like for four and a half percent right when you can get a car loan for zero those kind of things yes like six to eight percent is really too much to be paying and interest on your student loans absolutely right and so one of the ways to get out of that sooner is to cut your interest cost and finance you know there's a lot that goes on there like you can do it like travel hacking for credit card rewards you know what the bonus sign up so you can get like 50 miles so it's like my site we have cash back bonuses like $200,000 that you can get for refinancing your student loans so you get the cash back bonus and you cut your interest rate maybe from like 7 to 5% and then now you're getting out of debt you know way faster and so maybe you choose a 10-year repayment so you got 50,000 of data you choose a 10-year term you have a $500 a month payment and so maybe you're you're hacking away at that thing you got 50,000 down to thirty thousand and so your interest rate on that new loan is 5% well now you've got it down to $30,000 now you can refinance it again pick up another one of those cash back bonuses and choose a five-year term it like a three and a half percent interest rate and so now you got a dead even faster okay cuz cuz the monthly cost like reduces so basically when you see online like people trying to get you to refinance your student loans like obviously everybody gets an affiliate bonus for that or I feel you sure so it's like one thing it's kind of cool in the world is you have a little bit of optionality as the partner to decide how much you want to get back to the radar so with our site basically but the strategy in the can of the goals that we have is like how do we get the best cashback bonus to the user so will take less from our affiliate commission odd so instead of making like you know I don't know $700 of student loan refinancing we might make like a hundred two hundred bucks or something make $700 in a student loan refinance as it as it up yeah but you guys are the wrong business you know but I mean so there's a lot of like big named brain right now will finance websites out there give zero you know cash back bonuses for refinancing student loans because they keep the whole thing for themselves and so sing like I get it but you know I just think that if you're the end-user like you want to get the best deal you know you want to shop around you want to look for the place it's giving you the great cash back bonus and then hold on to that long for you know you're too while you're making payments and then see if you can refinance it again to get an even better deal let's go like picking up an additional Chase credit card to get another $50,000 is you're telling people or at least like when your scenario here when they do refinance at second time right they they fight refinance the first time to do it for 10 years they do a 10-year repayment plan this second time they do it they're not extending that repayment plan like you would have liked a lot of people who refinance houses right though they'll pay for 10 years or refinance and it goes back to a 30-year loan so that they load them up payment you're not that you're saying actually shorten it to five years yeah and then get them cuz I get to the lower interest rate and which may increase your monthly payments perhaps but you know it's later it's five years later money hopefully and your butt your interest rate will drop in in lieu of that person that that example that you gave me want to pay their debt off in 4 years that are already making way more than the 10-year repayment for student loans that lower the interest rate lower the interest and this whole idea of refinancing student loans is this because I mean I know companies like so Buy in Earnest of the time I don't know if there's any more I'm sure there are 10 years ago Capitol the government was giving all these loans at 68% instead of like way lower like before the financial crisis student loan interest rates were much lower than they are now got in so they just figured out that you know you could cut the he cut the interest rate a lot relative to the credit risk in the private lender gets to make you know yeah 1% more than the treasury rate on somebody that's like a physician he's like guaranteed to pay back their debt right so upset that so that's one reason why it's great to get rid of the you can now that makes me worried is like if you should have gone for forgiveness then if you refinance that's gone that's off the table you never go back to your site alone about 10 times as people reach out to me with you know 500,000 student loans with a refinance so they're making $150,000 and I'm like hey that was like a $200,000 like the steak Yeah they couldn't couldn't they would have worked 10 or even 20 years I could have got it forget forgiving yes not like it resets the clock like you refinancing you got 10 more years it's a finance of a second job you know that you got mouths to feed now should should anybody be worried I mean this is certainly worries me because I think sometimes I think everyone's out to get me or everyone's out for a malicious purpose you know I know it's not true big money during the Super Bowl that you know clearly they got money you said it happened right after the financial crisis is there concern about you know these companies sort of going under and what it what does that mean for people who have student loans with them or him hold the logs themselves that they package them up and they sell them to investors so if you know so if I were to go bankrupt like you would still be paying you know you're wanted some somebody yeah and so we were lucky for them to be bankrupt and then you didn't own alone and I don't know if this is you know I may be speaking out of turn here but the idea that like I mean my mortgage I add a mortgage I bought my house in 2008 and that mortgage got sold like 3 or 4 times in the last few know 5 years after I sell my house I'll get it and get that never goes away the interest rate never changes it just keeps getting passed along different companies right when they might leave it with the same loan servicer the same person might collect your payments but I know it could transfer around kind of behind the scenes that you've been seeing it but you know what the thing with the refinancing companies I actually have about eight Partners so so when you're talking about somebody who would refinance like who do they know about well they know about like so fine as many yet and he wanted to others and so I'm actually in places where people might get like a you know a 5% there but then they get a 1% lower rate somewhere else and so if you're talking about a big loan amount then you just got yourself like 2 3 Grand a year and a big loan amount and then on a smaller loan amount I could still be still thousands of dollars so it just did something that you got to be real cognizant of yeah yeah I think that for for anybody who's not like a $400,000 surgeon in California that's like about to buy a mortgage and buy a house and get a big mortgage like you're probably going to get a better interest rate somewhere else besides so far this point. It's oh so you were able to refinance and you did cuz the you got a cash bonus could you just refinance with Ernest and then yeah the cash bonus and then refinance with Laurel Road and get another button just keep refinancing I mean have to file a bunch of paperwork but literally get thousands of dollars oh yeah I did this is a real thing that you can absolutely do and you could refinance serious yeah I see you have the so file on it right and so you could go to Ernest and refinance like a part of it and get four hundred bucks that's like my current cash back bonus with them and then you could do like part of it would Lower Bucks and then you could be part of that would combine I got a $500 bonus with them and you can split it up like that I hope tons of people don't do that because I'll probably get in trouble and then you know you could just refinanced it again and you know 6 months to a year and you obviously if you already had an account with them they're probably not going to come back and give you another cash back bonus you have to have because I'm a reasonable strategy yeah let's go eat alone and split it up amongst a bunch of companies you can't just like refinance at all the so far and then just roll it all into Laurel and just bead stupid about it one place if those people choose to do that because at the end of the day it's kind of a pain in the ass to have a bunch of different loan payments so much different place right yeah it's like a full-time job Earnest refinance my loan yeah definitely oh okay so that's a good strategy if you do get into a self buy alone cuz you watch the Superbowl and saw a commercial and then you found out about Ernest and they were like well hey we can save you a full percentage point and then you're like oh and you don't you're not completely fucked right you could just go into into Ernest and save myself another 1% maybe even keep it a 10-year repayment plan or whatever because you know ABW found out within a couple months you know each other Nation so that was way lower than the contributed Capital to like the firm from all their Venture Capital investors so there is some concern like going back to you earlier point on refinancing space is so competitive right now and the fact that you know they're giving these cash back bonuses even is like an indication of just how can help Fierce the competition is for people that have good credit and everything so yeah there's there's absolutely going to be some companies that are going to go to our business especially when the next financial crisis happens so you know what you can lock in a lower interest rate now it's like you said good credit right so in order to get these loans these B's refinancing loans you need good credit and good income okay how many college kids do you know come out by college have any credit well that's the typical FICO score that they need at least that and so you know you can you probably have you know a 6:50 I mean like you unless you have like a bunch of delinquencies in default on a credit card you probably have a 6:50 and then probably you know 40 50,000 income to apply so most people from you know a decent University will probably have that level of I've been coming if you don't that you can use some of these income based repayment strategies some of these loan forgiveness strategies right so just because you can refinance doesn't mean you should so it's just depends on the person but yeah you do need to have decent decent credit decent income otherwise like you don't want to give you a right okay I guess before we head out what about not refinancing and not doing forgiveness like what's the fastest way for a regular you know run-of-the-mill college student to pay off their debt as fast as possible like what's it I mean like we've all heard the story is but like what's what's the realistic scenario there said to get rid of it. I mean well I mean if you're going to pay back with a government that you're absolutely going to pay a higher interest so all things all things that's like there's basically no scenario where you could get out of the debt faster yo if if you don't refinance if you're buying me back yeah but I mean like for example can you like you know the side hustle game is over paying an option absolutely and it should be two things that don't go sign up for a really big house payment or a lease and some fancy Bo condo in the middle of the downtown and then also don't sign up for a new car lot those are the two things actually that I found four thousand people that wrecked people's finances hold them back keep them for paying off debt it's almost always on your cars or housing okay so they say they rent a house or rent an apartment and how do you deal with the car since you like what it was another option that usually you know if they need a car to get around to get to work what's the option other than getting it alone or something but you want to answer you when I be yelled you're living with your significant other that kind of thing splitting rent like that's really important and another thing with the car situation as you can buy a $2,000 Honda Civic and cash on Craigslist it runs great right now anywhere in the country and so if you buy that you can drive around the you know 30 mile radius where you live and then you can go rent a car for like you know Enterprise or hot wire or something like that if you have a long distance trips for something it's more reliable so if you want something even more reliable than that you can probably have like $5,000 that you can spend on a car but almost anybody if you're careful with your money 2000 cash to go buy it like a Honda Civic with but what most people do is they get the new job they're like oh 0% 0 % so good I really must love me and they go to the car place you know and they don't understand it like the other bacon in an additional $5,000 profit margin to get the 0% loan to like make you feel special and so then they just signed up for like $100 a month car payment and then the other underwater in the thing and suddenly they've got 10 or 15% of their disposable income going to cars and set up you know you have just gas and that's it so say I listen to this episode and I was like that all sounds great but I just this is a lot of work I don't want to do any of it I just hit Travis can you do it for me M8 like go to you and she like Travis I have a sickening amount of debt just your problem we do the making plans for people custom plans to get him out of that as fast as I can so if I have like a hundred fifty thousand and student loan debt how much would it cost me to have Travis with a bunch of spreadsheet and I just fear my shit out will be it wouldn't be with me but if you opened one of my team members at that level is 295 at that level if you have a hundred fifty so I have like a team of folks that work with me and it'll be kind of segments it by that level so I actually actually pretty much only do debt consultations over 400,000 now and no we got teams like c a p oh my God what age do most yeah dude what I do for a living are they the big brain surgeons and lawyers and Poets row that is sunnier and then they went to like a Residency program to become an orthodontist and took out another 300,000 and they put the whole thing in there forbearance for 3 years what's forbearance does that mean like if you don't the payout for 3 years so the colleges only get punished if they like have somebody to fault within 3 years of graduation and so income based repayment like takes an explanation it takes paperwork but fear Barrett's all you had to do is say like I'm poor put your help me not make payments and like a minute right and so actually all these colleges have hired all these like Consultants not not stuff that I do not like any of these private groups to call these struggling borrowers and they put them into forbearance forbearance lasts a maximum of 3 years and that you're no longer allowed to use that you required to make payments like there's a couple pieces that came out in like the New York Times recently that like the tracking. The government to determine whether or not they get to keep financial aid so they are literally paying to save their own asses and then we'll get rid of Lily screwing all of the students program getting subsidies getting forgiveness cuz I don't qualify for any more interest it pushes the can down the road you know and they have to deal with it kind of on the road once the consultant that the college hired you know it's kind of off the books until I want one thing you'll see is like graduate schools have very low default rates because people are really educated at least know to get into like income based repayment but the percentage of people actually paying down their balance might be like at 90% but the government looks at that and doesn't track like how much people are actually paying down and so they're like wow this is so good this is such a success you know we should give these colleges more money and then like you know the colleges like they manage the statistics so they say off of the Raider of the government and so like they can't charge anything they want because they just put it all under forbearance and then the people don't you know and then they like are on their own and they all default I'm like so that's why I like that on 16% of all trades or something like that so I'm like I have like a million dollars and student loan debt because I'm like the worst basket Weaver ever and I I go hey Travis can you just do this all for me you like to 95 like on average how much do people say how much can you save people well yeah so if it's if it's over for 400,000 it's it's 595 if it's between 200 and 400 its 4:49 right so it's like $10,000 I wish it's it's still it's already 5 it was a request like over there in a life of their loan repayment right not like 1-year savings projected so it's like under the all these rules that you know could change but it's under the rules that exists Now 60 mm wow I thought that was like the average size of a student loan that's about 60 mm maybe not 28 20 to 25% of the one side zipper somebody with a million and if they have a lot of lot of stuff in there screwing up we probably would save them a couple hundred grand yeah yeah I was so I mean thanks for coming on telling us all this stuff and yeah you just said it but where it where can people really like fine more about you and what you offer so we have like unsealed car.
