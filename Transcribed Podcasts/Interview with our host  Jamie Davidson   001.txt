Net this is the podcast where we tap into the mind of a multimillion-dollar Amazon Seller and bring on other proven experts to discuss all things e-commerce I'm really excited about Today Show going to be joined by our host Jamie Davidson we're going to be talking about how he got started with e-commerce and how he built his company from 0 to 75 million dollars Yes you heard that right 75 million dollars in Daniasales in just 7 years so yeah let's go ahead and get started hey Jamie glad we finally get to do this definitely excited to hear your story thanks for taking the time to share a little bit of your background with us Andrew awesome yeah super excited for the podcast here and started to talk some Amazon great so I guess just to give the listeners kind of a background on on how you started in and got to where you are today can you just kind of take us back to when you started selling on e-commerce and I guess just how you got into all of this and a little bit of your background absolutely and Russo and every story is a little while you're has its own path to speak with in our case we had moved down my wife and my my boys and I move down to the Atlanta Georgia area in 2011 and up to that point I was currently move down to be a chief operating officer for a national touring company so would move down the opportunity and originally had a military officer background way back when but basically no corporate corporate background executive level head straight to in my next door neighbor the neighborhood we moved into was my next door neighbor Jason doesn't turn out to be what was selling cell phone cases out of his garage we first moved in and said he was an IT consultant and we become friends and it was kind of was almost humorous off in that the UPS guy was coming every day and they were shipping stuff out of there now so it was kind of I was just grab it similar to you don't have any friends sell on eBay you know a little bit you don't really think that much of it at the time and this was pretty early so 2011 and you with that we became became good friends and spend some time hanging out having dinner having some drinks together and chatting in the early years that point you know it wasn't even certain that this was going to be you know how big of a business is wiser with the opportunity was but you're pretty quickly and it became apparent that that segment started growing this is before we go to fulfillment by Amazon but cars that begin to grow Ed Jason another partner Brad and it's basically quickly took off so by point of 2012 and started growing really quickly and that's when you know when do this was a serious serious opportunity and ever since then we've grown each year and other and even this past year we grew to visit this a lot but now he's got a team of over a hundred Boys in China over and we've got team of about 30 people in Atlanta Georgia here with the warehouse but what kind of Skeletor large size with did over 75 million last year on Amazon and we've got our goal this year to do over over a hundred million in 2018 here so wow that's definitely incredible gross story for listeners that are just tuning in maybe they are just starting out on Amazon can you maybe take us through the process and the beginning that you went through or maybe other listeners are in a position where they are trying to start a business on the side can you kind of walk us through what that process looks like when you decide to leave such a you know well sounds like well paying career to pursue this business yeah I know it's it's issue question is because a couple things one is it every time. Different opportunities different and so you know Amazon at that point is little bit different then now Eva and there's a lot of lot of benefits now in terms of where Amazon is that it was less infrastructure that you need to create that we initially were crying like a free sample Warehouse really on to something that you don't need to get by but you don't ever need a warehouse right now you can grow the business you can grow the business 20 million + what is the handle all of that so some of the things we did early on her or not the same path we follow today for going after it and I know it was certainly less competitive you are sellers in the marketplace dad and so you know that also helped us do things a little faster than and I would take today in a little bit you know it's less investment than it would be due today but you know in terms of their own career it just Union in and you can identify this with yourself you know somebody sells on Amazon and and has made this decision as well right now is your opportunity cost because you know the more money you make in your current job the harder it is to just switch over and so am I case you know we're making over over half million dollars a year in the corporate world sometimes to be able to do this the switch careers is the song had to put a lot of thought to and you'll show my case was issued to help with Jason because he had to lead with you know jumping on the first and he was Neil we all went through the same thing like he had for your Brad was working at Coca-Cola and he's kinda had to wait incision but once you a couple things once you can see Financial you're going to be okay that makes sense that you're going to have enough security for family that's your that's one part of it that's why the biggest thing that you can hold you back because the actual idea of building your own business and and the idea of us a particularly I call it your time Freedom or just such massive thing so you know I talk about it's not so much that we are looking for time Freedom so that we could work like a lot less lot of times we actually work just as much or more than we are but it's just the ability to work on something that you really feel as your own and something your building for yourself as opposed to building for you I was even as a senior executive as if you seen the roles I was still basically you know helping a private Equity Firm ways to make money for someone else as opposed to actually be part of something that we're building ourselves really trying to trying to grow and I think that's that's a common thing I hear a lot of people we coaching work with that SOB yeah that the money apps was important cuz you got to be able to do that but it's really you know I think it would allow people to relate to his they want to do something that they can really buy into themselves and feel passionate about the bill can make a difference on the road if that's really what it came down to that you know as early as we could and I could have done it 15 years ago on some people lot of people work with them and I'm in my forties right are doing it much faster in 2018 it's also just helpful that it's not uncommon right you just see so many people that our it's not just with Amazon they may be doing working from your laptop doing digital marketing you no more and logging you know where you know what there's an endless type of things that you can do online just e-commerce for us it's just something we think just because of Amazon and Amazon is this just in from our perspective it's the biggest opportunity and everything but that's that's a little the background how we how we looked at it and you know made that made the switch Yeah well that's a great story that must have been a big decision for you as well with where you're at in your career guess it just goes to show you what an amazing opportunity Amazon or does he Commerce in general can be for somebody who treats you like a business yeah I know I mean it totally is totally different for everybody rather people that you know are making 100K two people making your daughter's college kids right out of college at realize hey you know they want to do something like this and I have and it does require some Capital bit so there's all different entry point right the market the Amazon Market doesn't care he doesn't care what your education background is doesn't care now you can you can apply and my thought is hopefully you can apply these experiences we've gained from other areas but the stories give me different mean and Andrew you know myself knowing you I mean how about how about yourself just curious if your mindset if just weighing you have the ability to yeah it's kind of not to leave a corporate Roll versus male pursuing and of an Amazon space in a full-time but what would you share from your perspective yeah it's interesting think I share a very similar mindset I look at it now or more so recently as opportunity cost like you said I was reading something and they were calling it The Air of entrepreneurs now because we have so many opportunities with that being said I think the biggest part for me was where do I want to be in 10 years are 15 years and if what I'm doing now in my current career isn't getting me there then every decision that I make from that point on is essentially opportunity cost so I think like you're saying it's harder for people are becomes harder and harder the longer you stay in your career and obviously the more money you're making so for me that was a big part of the decision sorry I thought you know it's we're all kind of doing the math in perspective and again with people with coach and help and you know you see there's just a lot of there's a lot of talent and motivated people are people that you're really I really want to be able to do something in a more tactful for for themselves for the families and they kind of have this pent-up energy to it out put it towards something that you can build an end provided that for us and it's great you know to see all the other people out there that you know I found this path now opportunity with with Amazon e-commerce as well yeah and I think you have talked about this before but I think a big part of it is you know you don't know what you don't know and before you had the internet and all of these podcasts and and everything where you can get all this information there could be somebody blocks away from you doing really well in an industry but now you know you kind of stumbled upon these things online and I think that's what led me at least two seeing how big of an opportunity this is obviously by just seeing businesses like yours it kind of gives you this where is before you might start a business and not know where to start their you can kind of look at a lot of businesses that are out there now and see okay well I could maybe I could get this some percentage of that on my own and I I think that's kind of the time right now and it's great it just shows you all the opportunities out there so what's your take on the opportunity on Amazon today in 2018 yeah and Russo been RIT with our own business and work where as excited even more so than they really we've ever been so I are growth injectors are our biggest gar biggest targets of growth that we've ever had this because he has many people seen the news and she online you know is always constantly a new story about Amazon's growth and Amazons growth and e-commerce Grocers continues to be huge so I think the most recent stats last year is at that eCommerce is still it's less than 17% of all all Commerce and over the next five years it's expected to double to still only be like less than a third of all, you're so unique about that still a very small percentage of all Converse is happening but it's growing really quickly rights of it at Popeye's getting bigger and bigger and bigger right so it's just a matter of you know there's no one out there saying no. it's shrinking or spotted so it's good luck keep in mind that pie is getting bigger and bigger and so it's a matter of you know who's going to have a piece of that pie and how you can access it and yes if my perspective mean as far as a bigger seller and we see opportunity as soon as you get further into Amazon Echo by Amazon I described as a video game that kind of unlock additional features to give you access as you get further into it is that you can approve yourself as a more serious seller that you're further allows you to grow your business but you know for those early on stage I think it's I think it's an awesome opportunity 2018 that's in a particular on Amazon and then you're down the road even additional things in the e-commerce Pace cuz you think about the world you know 10 years ago or even if you go back a couple even if I say I know what 12 years ago yeah the iPhone didn't even exist right it's like it's hard to imagine that is an existing think about 5 years from now things that you don't continue to the emergency system tools away or going to do things so you know the opportunity with Amazon we also think you'll be on Amazon his options with eating e-commerce it's just we always come back to Amazon first because your Amazon is just so dominant in terms of getting all of the customers there and they're getting a bigger share of customers there every year so why not develop expertise on that platform and which isn't that complex if you have enough knowledge Varsity how to do it and get your products in front of your the world's largest Marketplace you know the cell on an e-commerce oh yeah we're definitely not very optimistic about the thought you Converse in particular about Amazon in 2018 and certainly not even more so in the years ago and it goes back to your comments about in a position yourself well if you think you're down the road but you know we think 2018 and then you think about the next 5 years you know 2019-2020 you know how far have you going to be at the if this is something that you're you're focused on the very Basics and taking advantage of the opportunity it's going to continue get bigger and bigger as you go into the years ahead here yeah I totally agree so from the perspective of a larger seller on Amazon what would you say is the number one mistake that new Amazon sellers or maybe just do e-commerce sellers in general make that you see with students are coaching yeah I would say I'd say the number one mistake I'd see is people going into it without getting any help without doing enough get enough education on things beforehand so you can get started and not spend a lot of money but you want to have seen some people do is and its routes to each person cuz everyone has it I do need some level of investment capital in any business but in this day and age is that doesn't require alot but you know if someone puts in you know seeing someone put your $5,000 worth of Business Without Really just jumping into thinking they're going to throw it up there and that's all you need to do is think about Amazon it's not it's not overly complex and you know and you know she was not one task that is a super complex doesn't require calculus or you don't even know how to do it together it is or you know it's raining it's all pretty straightforward stop but there's just lots of you need to know you know you need to have some sense of a process that you should fall out and what you're trying to do and see if you can if you can do that you can you can be successful but if you're going at it with no idea then yeah I've seen a lot of people just basically waste money they come to us after in some cases after they spent a lot of money that they spent 10000-15000 20,000 going about it without but I don't know what they're doing and then a and then I realized oh wait there's a better way I should you know anything else I should invest in some knowledge of front and then do it the right way that way when you put your dollars towards as well so that's your that's by far the biggest one Charlie there's there's other other areas I'll be happy to touch on as well too but that's kind of the first one that comes comes to mind always yeah totally I agree with that 9% and I think you can spend a lot of time that you can basically shortcut if you work with somebody else who has already been there before time II for us like those areas you know what we don't have expertise in tonight in the e-commerce space play another space if we want you in this day and age we want to figure something out because it's not about getting the right answer in the marketplace in this is why we find this and everything else it's about getting the right answer or a very good answer quickly so if it's going to take us 2 years to figure out how to do something that's very expensive when we could determine the opportunity cost if we could figure out how to do something you know in a month or two months so that's why you know if there's something we want to do if you want to understand how to do Facebook ads while we're going to go find out the best people in the world that we know that that can help us do that right whether it's teacher do it it's worth it for us cuz it can speed is important so we need to be able to make French toast with Amazon is you have to learn the basics are now so you can learn stuff all over there and I could take was going to take you you know 2 years to do it and you said if there's a shortcut and you can learn something it's Dad in 60 days 90 days or the course of one year then then yeah that's going to make a massive prince in your you know when your on financial potential over the next 2 3 5 years yeah and I agree I think you know before I used to think more about don't want to spend money on this coarser don't want to invest in this education and later on I started to think more along the lines of I guess how you would think about the time you would have to spend to acquire all the knowledge and is it worth my money right now kind of like you're saying with Facebook is it worth you learning Facebook which would probably take you a year you know to get any work close to those experts Jack D yeah the bill either specialization ability to Tappan people and resources and help because your Amazon I'm just like every business is not a it's not you know a magical place where you just make free money you throw up places it takes it takes what about strategy takes know how it takes the person you're adding value to Market there's got to be a way that you know what you're doing on this opportunity is different than and someone who has no idea what you're doing right and so that's a good thing we like to see that you know it's those that know what they're doing those that I can write steps and it's not an ox but it does require people take action to move forward forwarded on the market place as opposed to those that are just too kind of blindly get seen and that's what makes it an opportunity because you know there's the differentiate between you know how you participate in the marketplace and you know it's just that as a healthy Dynamic that exist with Amazon in swai okay it was at the Apollo process could do well yeah yeah definitely so looking forward to touch on this a little bit but what is your team C with Amazon and the future and how are you making plans are positioning is maybe how you worded it for taking advantage of Amazon's growth whether that be here more so in the US or possibly internationally yeah absolutely Andrew so great question is is a couple things that come to mind one thing is is that we sell all of us we do exclusively private label so we do laundromat private label which is it we sell under our own brand name and it's not hard to do that. You basically this day in age you can create brand name got to make sure that no one else is using that name but what I did we talk about with our students often is the brand name is is not important like back in the day people would spend all sorts of time and you know when I get the coolest name we talked about in the Amazon World e-commerce is not important really it's relatively unimportant what that name is as long as it's available for you to trade market in the trademark well you don't need to do it right away is super important because as it comes to Amazon what we seen the trend in our year especially in the last even so in the last year and more so is that Amazon is really as Amazon's grown in total the marketplace is grown Amazon is really favoring those that are brand owners and so what and up our take on it is your Amazon has responsibility to to near Brea the marketplace consumers that you know it's reliable and that there's the brands that are on there are legitimate so if and they want to make sure that you're there is no price of a counterfeit Saint there in the course other brands I want counterfeit so their brands on there so all that being said if we really seen your Amazon more so than it ever has kind of favor in those that are brand focused which is pretty the fits right into our strategy if it's in to what we've been doing for a while and as opposed to other people just try to reach Arbitrage or find a way to sell other people's listings or even create you know lots of different brands and just try to make a little bit of sales product we really are approaching we really think this is you know it's been quitar stassen key that I think anyone wants S14 is really been around focusing on adding value via a brand so again the brand of super simple are you can just write a name on your Amazon listing that's your brand but I understand that you got to put some you know making sure that doesn't conflict with anyone else and then building a suite of products around that brand that has that makes some sense when you can sell with multiple brands on Amazon but you know if you think about that either you're selling on Amazon or that you're an e-commerce seller that using Amazon and you have a brand you trying to build that out and you have a mindset that you're trying to create value with that brand then you would think that's that's key terms of your then the sales will come the growth will and that's your that's what we have done and we're going to continue to do it just the last part of it and it your question that you reference a little bit you'll part of that the beauty of building a brand through and leveraging FBA which is fulfillment by Amazon or Amazon doing all of the doing all the warehousing of that product doing all of the filming of that product at the picking and packing and the customer service so mean all that stuff is Yo makes it super-easy is the ability to then replicate that internationally as well too so that yeah that was definitely a big part of our growth last year and Marcus like Germany we launch in Japan last year in Canada We Grown more recently so an Amazon continues themselves to try to make it easier and easier for sellers on the platform to the Gail do that so but yet truly Brands and the scale that that Branch grew up but y'all both and you ask for amazon.com and through the international markets that you reference right actually just got a email the other day did you see that Amazon I guess people in other markets can order from you if they're qualified for certain type of membership they can order from Europe and it'll still be fulfilled by Amazon I guess Amazon our last meeting was in a few months about 6 months ago and that was without a doubt in Seattle and one of their account heads that he was for one of the workers use for the Amazon Amazon was referencing that it wasn't sure the timing of it so and I know it trying to make it as easy as possible at that point was your the bility for FBA warehouses in the US were ever to basically try to break down the borders in North America so that it could be basically you know you're basically selling on FBA throughout all of the three countries together and then but I have heard they're trying to break down these are they can make it to do that and that's a great thing is there's a line at between sellers on Amazon and Amazon right so the more that Amazon can help us be successful and he was on the platform Yeah the more they can achieve their goals continue to grow and and really dominate retail space at the latest but that doesn't surprise me cuz that's right line with a few months back I was super interesting they're getting to the point now where they will even ship hear you're in overseas that's pretty aggressive or tuning in if they want to get more information about connecting with you is there anywhere that they can go to kind of learn more about the business or any advice
