welcome to the baseball America College podcast on Teddy Cahill today on the the baseball America College podcast we've got Arizona head coach Jay Johnson inj is here to to talk about the Wildcats going into the the 2019 season wrapping up a 2018 campaign that was a little disappointing for for Arizona missing the postseason one of the first teams out of the field of 64 but they're going to be looking to get that corrected here so we going to 2019 and they've just gotten their fall ball campaign started and they started in kind of a a unique actually no it is just a unique fashion with the Mexican baseball Fiesta there in Tucson and and what that is is that there's some professional teams from Mexico that the come up and you'll play in Tucson and the Wildcats were able to to play one of those those proteinsand that was actually on the first day of of Team fall ball activities that they started their fall ball with the challenging opponent there and you will see how that how they progressed through the rest of the their fall but you know it's good to get that going right away and find out exactly what you've got right from the jump and especially true I suppose when you have as many young players as Arizona does this year was a strong recruiting class coming in right number 13 in the nation especially big heavy on the pitching side for Arizona this year that they brought in a number of arms that they're they're going to now rely on over the next few years as they kind of revamp their pitching staff to be able to go out and compete in the Pac-12 and in chase chase that Regional bid and try to get back to Omaha where the course they last war in 2016 Jay Johnson's first year in Arizona when they finishedNational runner-up to Coastal Carolina so plenty going on in the the Arizona program and in jail get to a lot of that here you so we'll we'll just get right to this interview here with Arizona head coach Jay Johnson today on the baseball America College podcast like I mentioned we have Arizona coach Jay Johnson Jay welcome to welcome to the show today awesome day thanks for having me on absolutely it's fun to fun time here you guys are getting started with fall ball it's hard to believe we're in the middle of October already but you guys got things started here really kick things off with a game against marineros de Hermosillo of the Mexican Pacific league in the Vamos a Tucson Mexican baseball Fiesta can you just kind of explain what that that tournament is all about there in Tucson yeah it was a great experience and the Mexican baseball Fiesta came to us last year and wanted to include us you know where big part of the community obviously here and you know 5,000 people on the stand per game until we got to play the opening night in you know the best team in the event which had a bunch of pro players that's big Leaguers double-a and Triple-A guy to put the uniforms on for our freshman and first year players to get in that type of atmosphere really the first day of practice was a great opportunity we saw a lot of good things and it gave us good springboard into what we want to do in the fall you ran out a lot of players in that game which finished 222 I know you were concerned about the score at the stage of the Fall better be just what way did you see that you liked her that you wanted to improve on is as the fall continues now yeah I think there's the best takeaway was the length of the pitching we through nine players and eight of them were new pictures one inning a piece and of the nine guys eight of them were over 90 miles an hour at some point in the evening and so I think the depth in the arm strength that we were able to bring in with his new class was great to see I think it was great to see their mental disposition be able to slow the game down and really fill up the strike zone and they only gave up four hits the entire night which was very impressive and you know I'm taking it pretty well we are good 9 or 10 hits and didn't I didn't really look over Matt's overwhelmed and not chase out of the zone and patience for where we are in the development of our team and I think that's a credit to some of the Talon of our players at one of the players on there and heroes was Salazar your former catcher I mean just goes out like a competing against him what was my first game in Arizona without him has our catcher so it was a little bit by the Astros last year and is playing in the pro league down in Mexico this winter and he's on his way and not experience having him in the opposite Dugout that's for sure no doubt so I guess that this game was you used it as the international game that you're so I mean what what do you get out of here when you play some of these teams from other countries you know that they have different styles of play in this case they weren't there an older group I mean just what is that kind of bring to the table for you well I think there was a lot of positives I mean how often do you in a college baseball setting play in front of 5,000 people you know it's especially in October and so we get those types of crowds here in Tucson and so I thought it was a tremendous learning experience for our players to be able to deal with you know that type of environment which you know we'll see later in the year and that much more prepared for it hopefully I think when you look at the quality of the competition was very strong and I think it didn't make a lot of what we see in the Pac-12 you know professional players a couple guys from Hermosillo that were 94 to 97 all of them could throw a breaking ball for a strike they were matching up ring and Lefty's out of the bullpen so it was a really good challenge it at this point and I think just setting the foundation for competition getting to play in a close game and they know that we are headed to the one late late in the game and learning how to operate in those types of environments and really to do it without having practice or trained as a team until the day of the game I think it was great play Cal State Fullerton and then BYU a little later in the fall so we're really looking forward to those opportunities also to me that you're just examining how everyone handles fall ball in different parts of the country in were you are of course you can start later because you can play later I mean do you like that aspect of it being able to get the kids in school and acclimated doing individual work for a while before you get into the team fall practice yeah hundred percent and then we started strength and conditioning the very first day of school I've had this morning we actually listed for the 29th time already so dark that the individual work and those types of thing I think the later start benefits us tremendously and it allows the pictures to you know either let them rest your arm a little bit coming off of the summer or reboot their arm if they took the summer off and get 6 to 7 weeks of quality throwing program in before they ever step on the mound so that's probably the best benefit of it and then the other benefits of having a little lighter schedule you know getting adjusted to call its life and those types of things and I think the best one is that we don't have as much time between when we finish our competitive ball segment to the start of the regular season and so the foundational pieces that you put in as far as teaching and development as far away then if you had to start earlier you mentioned the the recruits that you have coming into the big recruiting class this year that we ranked number 13th overall in the country and you guys like Austin Wells and and Bryce Collins and exciting arms like Randy Abshire and in Georgia area is Junior and me just when you look at this group I mean what stands out to you about this class yeah I mean I think we had a 3 full years to recruit them and so I think the quality of it is as good as we had since we've been in Arizona and you know very excited about the Improvement you don't need to be on the mound in the pitching staff and I referenced you donate in the nine guys were 90 or better at some point in that Hermosillo game and you know couple of young freshman was only an inning but you know if last three or four pitches you know Collins was 92 94 Arias's 91 and 93 you know both you know struct you guys out in the game of their three out if they got Randy Abshire big arm with a lot of upside lot of potential you know was really throwing the ball well and it makes it in a few transfers on RT left-hander really looked electric Nate Brown transfer from Florida to the ball really well was really down in the zone with three pitches for strikes and good for now so I think it's a deep deep recruiting class and side which you know we want to really build a staff that creates a lot of problems for people and they're all different all coming at you and you're all tough to hit a pitching right off the bat was really excited about these guys and now we're working extremely hard to develop them to be to be the best player they can be seen as you guys said about kind of rebuilding this pitching staff after a lot of guys have moved on graduation Pro Bowl your pitching philosophy and just in general I mean you don't you often times don't have set rules don't the last offseason laundry you often times are looking just to play matchups and you like to have guys who are very versatile on the magic you just kind of explain where were you coming from with the with your pitching philosophy yeah they never won you know we're going to treat every game like it's the Superbowl and we want to win every time we step on the field and we want to put pictures in the best position to be success and sometimes you know they're in college for a reason you know there's something missing otherwise maybe you know would be a first or second round pick so setting them up for Success you know that's really where the matchup thing comes in I think secondly it gives more players a chance to make a positive contribution to the team and I can improve your team Dynamic when you're doing that you're using more guys so that's very valuable as well and you know when all reality I think we have some guys that could you know emerge into you know why did you say we're going to run this guy out every Friday or every Saturday for the course of the season and if we can do that by all means we want to do that I just don't know that we've had the types guys to compete at the top of the Pac-12 to be able to do that so we had to find a different way we did that and you know but if if a couple of more non Emergen you know beyond head about 3 times to the lineup and then hand it to a set-up guide and a closer I'm all for that so hopefully hopefully we can move and maybe a little more conventional Direction the Super Bowl mentality there that I mean I did the one thing I noticed when you guys were making the run to the the World Series Finals in 2016 was just the various motivation techniques that you have and that's that's one of them that that you get them to your players to buy in that every game is a Superbowl and after every when you guys take a picture so that you guys don't remember the win and no one win at everyone matters and where do you come up with some of the stuff in and where it where does some of that stuff originate from well the motivation behind it first it is called baseball the very physical game and we look at it like a 50 16 playoff I mean in all three years here in 16 and 17 we were probably one win away from hosting a regional which we all know what a significant advantage that is you're probably went away from being in the NCAA tournament so let up or you know not bring your bath and then just for survival in the Pac-12 with the type of quality players that are in the conference type of quality coaches that are in the conference so as far as where it came from and I got some good mentors my dad was a really good high school football coach ahead of his time with some of that stuff and then chill at San Diego who is really good that you know really trying to get players you know to really compete and to really nobody can sit there on the attitude and concentration and effort that you know you can't do that just by Rollin the balls out so whatever way we can get him and gauge and locked in on being the best they can and your team's generally are pretty loose in The Dugout and that might be an understatement I mean the whole country kind of saw that I guess during the World Series but I mean you've got guys if we just are having fun playing the game and how much do you do you just want to let them run with that stuff or do you ever try to bring them in at all at what are your thoughts about that a lot score run so with that being said I want them to want to be on a baseball field more than I want to be anywhere else in life and so far and being able to play free if it is in that type of thing and so some of that comes out now we've got a couple those players that were what you would call the ringleaders of that deal move on so it'll be interesting to see what type of take on but really it's it's more of a we're going to we're going to recruit really good players and let them be themselves as long as they're totally engaged and competitive we're not going to pick at every little thing that they do I personally love it and I just think that you know these are these are college kids having college kids like their they're just enjoying their college experience in If part of that spells over into the Dugout or they shoot music videos like I I just think that's awesome. Anything but baseball so I'm not taking credit for any of that so do you have a favorite video that Sawyer gieske shot when when he was there you know what is he was a talented guy and I thought they were all good and you know I'm in a lot of ways and that's the way kids are not any way that you can promote your program is is a positive and you know we're thankful that Sawyer has some talent to do that and did a really nice job with that and he did so all good on our end with that stuff you mentioned how you felt like you guys maybe we're just a win away from the NCAA tournament last year and and you certainly were one of the first games out of the tournament it seems like it I mean it just seems like that team may be on the road couldn't get things going in a sort of a Groove I mean what do you have as You Look Tonight teen what are you looking for for this team to take a step forward to get back to the postseason yeah I mean it it was an interesting season because it was one when she finished up you didn't you didn't feel like a failure and what I mean by that is we were 20 + 6 + games are non conference RPI was 11 and we won six of arctan Pac-12 series and so on the surface it it just it I feel like we are in NCAA tournament and it would be very easy though to sit back and go out were fine and that this an ad and instead I give her players a lot of credit we we basically have just you know taking a hard look at everything we could do a little bit better in terms of you no self-discipline fundamentals all those types of things that will put us over the top and so far we've had a great start to this year and a lot of new players but very much getting integrated into a culture of hard work and toughness and fundamentals and you mentioned the road thing. hopefully the decisions are making on a daily basis and your commitment to the right things will will put us where we need to be there's no excuses about that action you know on a daily basis is being taken to to improve us and every phase and and right now I don't know if that leads to any type of different results but but we're putting forth the effort to make sure we're on the right side axle you talk about how there's some new faces but there are also some pretty solid returning players guys like Cameron Cannon and Nick cantana and Buchanan kind of had a breakout summer in some respects in in Cape Cod and seems to be a guy that that's garnering interest at as we look to the the 2019 draft I mean he's a guy that is pretty versatile in the infield just what are you looking for from from Cameron the spring school early so when we got the Arizona we still have the opportunity to recruit and sign in or above-average hands he had a really strong arm so has all the makings of a really good you know whatever you want to call it top 25 or Fireside shortstop as far as the pro game you know maybe the second baseman maybe the third base and I'll let somebody else beside that I think you freeze good versatility there where he could probably be a plus Defender at all for infield spots and then the hitting thing he has enough power and bat speed and baseball aptitude to really hit enough to play any of the four infield positions and we're just looking for that slight Improvement I believe he was an honorable mention all Pac-12 player last year which we probably could have been an all Pac-12 player in Omaha that always breaks out but I think he's got all the ability in the world I think he could be a future Major League player and it has really really improved you know in his time here and if the jump from the sophomore year did the junior year is as big as the one from the Freshman of the sophomore year that'll be great for our team and in great for Cam and he just loves loves baseball in and I love coach and player that love baseball when it certainly makes things easier I mean like you said you would you want guys that want to be out at the field more than anything else and so there you can get guys like that I guess that's that's at least half the battle it feels like yeah no doubt in you and you mentioned the katana he's the same way that a long day and those guys have been great and everything they've done a great job leading the good players with the recall you being also yeah so yeah I mean my favorite baseball team quickly transition to the Cleveland Indians what they've done with that organization since he's been there is is remarkable a tough loss of the Astros yesterday but another championship another great season and you know I'm sure it's a little sooner than he wanted but we're looking forward to seeing the back in Tucson hear this offseason awesome you also mentioned much earlier now I'm about to just the atmosphere in Tucson it and you guys have a great College atmosphere and especially at the baseball games me just what was that like playing in front of the Tucson crowd well first and foremost it's a tremendous home field advantage you know we've been really successful over 3 years at home not that long ago highly competitive schedule when you have half the Pac-12 games not at home and I think it's for a number of reasons but you know we have reached around I can't remember what's 3300 of 3800 game last year which is always at the top in the last and there's an infant to high Buzz high-energy environment we were beautiful ball park what I've noticed most about being here in Tucson and there are fan bases extremely loyal you whether it's football basketball baseball and Good Times bad times did they show up there behind you and you're always encouraging you to tell me you're doing a good job and it makes it really really special because it's just very many places across the country inn in college baseball and we're lucky to have that are absolutely what J before I get you out of here I I just want to hear your thoughts on the playoffs I know that's an exciting time you mentioned it the Indians being out that's my hometown team so unfortunate that they were eliminated already but I mean just what do you like about watching the MLB playoffs every fall yeah I think first and foremost it's a great learning opportunity for our players because you know we mentioned the college baseball season Vehicles dance than like a 56 gameplay off where we feel like every time we take the field were in a playoff game and so the fundamentals the things that might not be noticed in a major league regular season baseball game gets magnified playoffs go first and foremost we use you know every day you know what teaching opportunity for something that happened in a in a playoff game and I think this year I think it's a unique deal where you know you probably have the five best teams left for sure in terms of Talon and rosters and you know I don't have no breaks out on payroll but I think it's going to be great these last couple weeks I certainly don't have a dog in the fight but I think it should be great too great great to see how it unfolds and lucky for for us it's a good learning opportunity for a player's absolutely what will be seen Arizona back on the Dimond in the spring thank you so much today for for joining us here on the baseball America College podcast today you got to tell you talk to you soon thank you again to Arizona head coach Jay Johnson and I just think it's such an interesting way that they started fall ball and what with that that game against the the Mexican team in the there in that their home park your kind of just a great way to get started in your fall season and it's a fun connection having sales are Salazar come back to and it was interesting that Jay said that was his first game at Arizona without says are behind the plate and and he was such an integral part of that team and right from the jump coming in as a freshman and in being able to to catch for the Wildcats and catch for that especially that team National runner-up team you're so now the Arizona's trying to find some new guys to take them back there and you would like Jay mention there's there's a strong freshman group there and they were able to see some of his arms in action which is important for them Arizona is just a fascinating program I think to watch going into this year that got guys see a light like we mentioned Cameron Cannon and Nick katana who can be some draft prospects guys and they have these young players coming in and it's going to be a hungry program having missed the the field of 64 last year as soon as they transition kind of into this this new core and try and get back into to Pac-12 contention there there going to be a team to watch the screen and I think they can be in in line for a pretty good years as long as they can get that pitch in lined up and you know that that's one thing that Arizona typically has done pretty well under under Jay and and pitching coach Dave Lawn is that they usually the end of the day they can I find a way to get the most out of the the pictures they have on staff so what will look for it to see how they they do that this season and of course that they've definitely been very offensive to park pretty well and you know it's it's it's a bigger park it says the former Big League spring training site so they don't know what they got to do to win in Tucson and they're usually pretty good at it so yeah this year if they will see how they they pull it all together but you know I think the Wildcats can can be pretty dangerous team again this season is as the Pac-12 kind of looks like it might be a little more open you've got Oregon State coming off of those two incredible seasons of course but with Pat Casey retiring and the core of our next year and Madrigal all moving on to the Pro Bowl haven't been drafted in the top 40 pics that you maybe they're not going to be maybe they still will be the Juggernaut of the of the conference but at the same time the other there was a lot of turnover to be weather in Corvallis and some of these other teams in the Pac-12 be at UCLA or or or Arizona or maybe cow with the Andrew Vaughn coming back to leave the way you did Stanford of course as well still going to be strong maybe there's some room at the top of the conference now for some of these other teams of course Sanford did win the conference last year they edged Oregon State and Washington but Oregon State ultimately wins wins the title so exciting times on the west coast and Arizona figures to be at the Forefront of that front of the foreseeable future I was Jay Johnson leaving that program it's obviously like Jay mentioned a very committed fanbase very committed community in the program traditionally of course exceptionally strong and the word we're going to look for that to continue and I'll be excited to see the Wildcats this Sprain and and see what they got to see some of these young kids and and what some of these returning players are able to do is as they get into their Junior and soft season soap again thank you to Jay for joining us here today to talk about Arizona baseball on the baseball America College podcast and weekly College podcasts doing interviews
