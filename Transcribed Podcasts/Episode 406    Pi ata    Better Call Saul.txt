Episode 406    Pi ata    Better Call Saul
feelings mean to the Washington the watch and talk drink 3 Long Island Iced Teas what's your buddy's worse off on you throw his car key criminal lawyer Bornstein you better and I'm John Booker you're listening to better talks all in this podcast we're not pretending to Breaking Bad doesn't exist so tread lightly if you're concerned about that shows spoilers and is always at her page and subscribers you ever heard me say this before John a timer three I think I could maybe even recited myself well I know we want to send a big shout-out to your premium subscribers Shaquita June in Kaka and ever and if you want to be a sporting goods, it's okay I am really really doing well I'm really glad to be back on better talks with you because I feel like men weird this season is just getting more and more exciting it's been an amazing season already but they are just teasing us with where this is going and where to get into the I think the reason many of us wanted the show in the first place to get into the high Jinks of Saul Goodman and it seems like we're actually almost there where we going for that going for my candy toll booths for most of the I never would have guessed how much I would have enjoyed Mike throughout this this show but I will say Mike in the toll booth probably the least interesting thing Mike does on the show Mystery of the tide like in the very beginning of Breaking Bad Gus is more of a characters in the series it sort of fits you know with with with Saul being Saul Goodman was really just the caricature in Breaking Bad I mean he was great he was fine he was funny but he was just a caricature and now he's a full-blown character and you could probably say that about Gus and Mike anybody else you know that nacho anybody else that appears in Better Call Saul they've been fully fleshed-out is characters Jimmy if she could only know now what's going to happen I think she would maybe maybe wouldn't have gone to Schweikert its Journey knowing where this all ends up going through that throughout the episode and what kind of talk about Jennifer Hutchison Parsons Jennifer Hudson's one of the classic writers from the breaking bad days she's written many many episodes in the most famous especially I mean the lines she wrote the line Jesse asked me if I was in the business of the money business neither I'm in the Empire business I don't deliver that stuff with me and also the line I'm the one who knocks and that whole monologue before that as well which is just like she also wrote the episode Salud poisoned everybody from Donna Latios gang our area or whatever the case maybe she's really good at the Revenge was really heavily rivers in this episode sold nice also was directed by Andrew Stanton this is first episode of Breaking or Better Call Saul on Breaking Bad and actually he doesn't drink much TVs a film director do you know who this is I'm trying to remember the name super familiar what what is he known for that's right Dory Finding Nemo he directions to Wally wow what a change of pace to come over and work on Better Call Saul TV show reminds me of fish from McCrory right like that he came from some of the mission impossible franchise in the driveway and stuff like that so yeah give me delivery mail and coworkers are talking about the betting pool for the Oscars and there's some people more than others that's for sure and having just run a big inheritance lawsuits using his knowledge of obscure case law questions about the case or whatever Jimmy is left out of the conversation completely goes into the they have in the back and close the door and begins to this is the moment he becomes Jimmy Miguel this is the moment you decided to become a lawyer apparently the straw that broke the camel's back on that so what do you think the importance of this is from like from your perspective so far this season you know they're giving so much screen time to this seen that it it's hard to believe that there's not something bigger going on with the scene I think you know the low-hanging fruit would be well is it a surprise to us that we're getting to see Chuck again you know that I think they wanted that to be a good you know audience surprised that we always thought we lost Chuck and you know he's such an interesting character so we get to see chalk and flashback I think that's part of the motivation for the scene was just sort of delivering something they thought the audience would want but I think I think they're going to pick up on that particular case that Kim was fan fangirling about you know that was was Chuck's case I just don't think so he wants her interest and completely loses it talks about that so it seems to be a way that he actually how we always kind of thought he became a lawyer to impress his brother and and impress his brother I think he always wanted his approval from his brother that's how I became a lawyer and seemingly pushed us to think that he actually became that's possible I I don't know it's just a hunch I have literally no proof but I really do think there's something bigger going on with that seen that they're going to pay off later it was too big of a set up just to have such a simple speeding I don't know it doesn't land is large with me is it does with you I mean let's think about seeing the scenes with him when he was working on the company gray matter obviously just leads to leading to something bigger per se but important part about that was to show why he is not accepting just making a lot of money that the money isn't even important thing right like when it says you have more money to spend contacts to the money wasn't the the thing that he wants but I think this is important because of Kim and then we see this separation happened in this this this Wall-E is seemingly and go off on their own and just something he can never get back into and I believe that the point of it is to show how you know why he got into the field and realizes once he loses Kim that you know that's not necessarily what you want to do anymore you just want to be a lot in election I think he wants to use the law with his little cell phone stop and kind of combined us together that make sense you could be right and I will be the first to say you maybe spot on on the on the money but I'll be honest I I feel like that's a little too clean and easy for his motivation of why I became a lawyer I think she might but I think Jimmy is a man he was constantly looking for the next way to to scam and to make money and if it's just this really pure-hearted thing for him in the beginning I don't know I think it we can just character I think his his desire to become a lawyer will unwrap more about his his devious ways I can get into a debate in one single detail about this is a part of his motivations I think that was the moment he became a lawyer and that's because I'm oversimplifying easy way to explain it I think it's just showing a part of his cuz obviously Chuck was an aspect of it obviously Marcos was a part of this and get away from that life, I think this is literally when he was trying to not be like that but that's why he became away from that he was scheming yeah I do I don't know that he was scheming in that exact moment but I don't know I think part of this because we're truly debating is the deepest nature of his character and Jimmy's Bay psychology is Jimmy and in this is the question that we may disagree on is Jimmy a bad person that sometimes it's does good things are a good person that sometimes does bad things question does it's not no it's not it's about it's almost over simplified as your example of Kim making him become a lawyer in that sing the best argument I'm completely wrong and I owe me an apology one if you energy for one purpose for Breaking Bad and all of Better Call Saul purpose of flashbacks are if you had just think of one purpose that they use on the show flashbacks completely different than the use of flashbacks on the show Lost the Lost use flashbacks for context to give contacts for one phrase for the purpose of flashbacks and I'm just curious what you would say but how would you answer that cuz I have a clear answer I am going to lean into Euro if you're here forever I'm going to defer to you and I'm going to say I think it's to show people's backstories to show their current motivations motivation number one purpose of ice packs in Breaking Bad this is why I think that's the case isn't important it's the fact that we use viewer don't understand what the hell they're fucking talking about right and Jimmy is about to be able to be in the cool kids club with them so I feel like we always thought that it was I think this is going to Kenwood way more important than we initially thought that I would agree with you John Rogan podcast in the show the deuce on HBO 20 minutes what even is Joy Reid debate like Rune the high school placement alright so after the opening credits we have Kim at the beginning she's trying to record a briefer Mesa Verde seemingly for her paralegal does she even calls her out to ask her for a couple things and I'm like the paralegals not there she's recording this button is distracted by the for Public Defender cases so she is full-on interested in that at this point I think that they man to do a great job of showing things without hitting it over the head with it I really enjoyed them allowing us to kind of figure that out on her own why Kim liked you know going in and taking these these cases and then I also like that they went ahead and you know confirmed her suspicions they didn't just leave us hanging in and let us know yeah you you were right about that if this is what you were thinking about her and maybe one disadvantage of doing a this podcast with different episode of this is one of the most interactive shows to watch when you're watching it with another person and Mike is up to something right Mike is doing some plan and he's buying these you know supplies and you don't know what the hell he's doing until it's all done you're watching with the person you're as opposed to it just him saying I'm going to do this and then you see him doing it right it's not as interesting that way and that's what is a good example of finding out what's going on with Alex I think you bring up a really good point this this show is a lot more fun to watch with people than just by yourself which you know that kind of leans in to wear our culture is out of people wanting the social experiences by yourself but I think this is still a show that works really well to play one time per week and give people time during the week to talk about it and post their theories before they answer any questions the next week also somebody actually wrote in this week I don't remember exactly what the issue was but we gots we were speculating about something last week that The Insider podcast completely and unequivocally explain that so we waste time discussing something that was already cleared up and this is why don't you listen to that before you do and I'm like information on The Insider podcast is for you to get from The Insider podcast I'm not going to I'm not going to listen to that and then just going to retreat like in a retread for everything they said right there I want to I want to watch this like you listed the listeners out there watching this right and come up with my own cheat cheats necessarily but you know I don't even watch the trailer so next episode so sometimes I didn't know what's the trailer like I don't want to like there's a lot of people like me this isn't like to watch the next episode cuz we don't want to be spoiled or something so I do watch the trailers and I'll be honest in the trailer for this next episode they did reveal something that probably going to enjoy more than I do because you don't know it's coming packing my watching Lost in 24 days I was just excited for the trailer for The Next Episode yeah yeah yeah and now I'm very calm and collected about the next episode when Kim turns and Ferb what was such a sweet moment to me he was dreaming it was it was a vulnerable moment I love that before and resorts in Navel gazing and Kimberly decision-maker juicer but man it is so much cleanup you make juice once and if so is it as loud as the one that Jimmy was using listen to it I think so I don't think it's like stealth referring Billy gatwood to him and then asks about how Jimmy has been coping since Peck funeral would you like one house with two double wide mobile homes have been set up to be used by the construction crew pretty quickly figure it out but when he starts going at like at least at first I was like a sentence or two into it I was like this is because then the people that are doing the drilling in the six months on Mike's part to be like we want to keep them happy yeah means it what's interesting is we're learning more about Mike through what he's doing for these Germans that are going to come in and we're actually learning a little bit more about breaking bad right because we're we're seeing you know when they cut to the exterior of of this place it's so nostalgic to think back of how many times we saw that in Breaking Bad but it also sort of makes the fact that we you know watched Breaking Bad feel more meaningful we know the full story behind how this location came to be I think it's the flashback so you know you're added one extra motivation to really well understood as jumping head but it seems like I give them at least one of them a sense of entitlement yeah I think they were maybe just trying to build more around that one character who Mike is clearly you know said let's keep an eye on there's there's obviously something going to happen not going to go south right yeah that's like one of my things that are you last long on my prediction last week was the gym that the purpose of a note that those kids jumping Jimmy was to show the dangers of slipping into you know the Slippin Jimmy I'm not necessarily to show Revenge dark but I was wrong would be a very very it would keep the men from climbing walls jr. almost year long project that they have and then Mike also tells Gus surveillance camera to inform us of a bad infection could you think you was talking about when you said that well I sort of just assuming assumed he was talking about Salamanca because of you know we know Salamanca is in the hospital and Gus's been very concerned about him so that was just fired another person was talking about when you said did you think of one of his wounds that's a fair that's a fair conclusion to jump to just wasn't where I went well maybe I'm wrong on that so I'm not the first do we have to leave Mike to explain the list of Necessities Tyrus and he's like they all remember and Mike is skeptical of that but he doesn't he goes along with it anyway so this day this is a moment that Mike and Tyrus learn to trust each other SNCC mobile Jimmy continues drawing W and doodles changed know that they put on the wiki is a Jimmy is more emotionally affected by the news of mrs. frost passing out of Chucks boy Hummel figurine I wonder if I wonder if this is and we never know what the show is this with the tape just like you did in the pilot episode or is this is this it's it it's anybody's guess but I think the Hummel figurine is is going to definitely come back into play now if it's Thursday, we going from Breaking Bad to Hummel figurines be well let me let me pose even another possibility though they have brought that up when I first turn Jimmy asked about it I thought oh man what what a slimy thing to ask about Jimmy's concerned about you know this Hummel figurine like can do it nobody knows that thing's valuable can I go get it and make money off of it which is kind of where my mind with the tape he seems to be and I'll be sad that she's gone at least let me watch the commercial for sandpiper which mistras appeared and which reminds us of the pilot Call Saul commercial when he arrives to that Kitchen and Bar where she poses Gisele with him you can wait for him it's waiting for a table that scene where he was pissed off and maybe a little. I think he was all drunk and he start planning out a con for him to do and then he comes in on his face when he's discussing and he has the spiteful look on his face and you were just joking around or just kidding right yep sample of how Kim can snap him out of that yep and think of who's going to be there to snap him out of it if Kim is not there yep alright so Jimmy Jimmy's informed that she's been hired to the is ahead of of Schweikert and took these new banking division or they was offered him to kick rocks and she's like I'm interested this allows me to have people take care of this stupid work I don't want to do and allow me to take over phone cases of public defender's office cuz she's like isn't she said the line I like it I'm good at it yeah that sounds familiar yeah that sounds familiar right out of Breaking Bad Walter and you still wanted to go back to practicing with her and then she explains that's going to work with and she knows that this is going to be tough for him to go to the bathroom and he seems to have a little panic attack going to say that we had not seen it before and I don't know it seems really out of character for him like nothing rattles Jimmy so what why do you know why this is why I don't know it just it's odd that we haven't seen him react to anything like that before so why is this is this first time that's ever happened that he's had this panic attack and anxiety yeah right from the death of chalkin he's completely compartmentalize that he's struggling with it it's showing him alone and he's not struggling with it at all pushed it out of sight out of mind struggling with it and this is not the way that we all thought he was going to take it but I know they did I love what I was going to say I love that they you know continue to disrupt what we expect but that would really threw me for a loop it really did so what are you going to ask him to pursue her new career path let me see Mike go to Stacy's home knock on the door and then she apologized for the police to confront him about that even though she's still he still believes it this corresponds with the Gus and Hector storyline as well right time and place is a big issue about that and he becomes too obsessed with making the revengers worse as possible that it becomes a weakness his only weakness right and says that need is not happy and says he calls her and he's like do you think she's going to come back into play it seems like it seemed like there was something there to me I mean we can never see her again I'm trying to see some Jonathan Banks but shots but we'll see I wanted to be like the recent season of Game of Thrones with Jon Snow and you see his I text you know and I want that right that's what I am going to go throw up right now thinking about Jonathan Banks saggy but that's a but we can all aspire to right there I agree I aspire to be that but myself and I grease on take Kaylee up from school the following day Jimmy visit a $5,000 check I could totally write you a $5,000 check if it would make you super happy now it wouldn't clear but I could totally write it for you if you would let me know hold a lot of Joya semi-good if you want to show how much of a fan of the show and you are of the show and I can really use it exactly $5,000 so if you don't then you're not a fan of the show I understand and you don't appreciate the work that I put into the stuff that's that's fine if that makes a bad person that's basically just change every listener that they're bad person owes me $5,000 they clear their conscience sweetie you don't understand I'm not a bad person I had our savings account baby Sweetie is that the horse is dead and partly is because of difficulty paying out trucks estate image of his plan was to just doesn't answer and then he tries to move because of one little setback your business and he's sitting there a little setback and he's like salesman in an hour, only goes fuck you Jimmy that's our one pack of the seasons they always give us one right that it that's for sew a MC well up so he can put up that little warning sign that says the show features explicit language that gives one person using TV and it's you know I mean so they are interaction there's always sort of like a little moment where you feel like oh actually maybe they're they're going to you know share a moment there they're going to connect and then the rug gets pulled right out from under us we find out that part of the reason that he hated Howard so much is all trucks doing Chuck was manipulating at in living and asking how it is is partner to be the bad guy for him yeah I mean a lot of times and he was dictated but what a good job he doesn't play this role I think that he has to be he seems in interviews. It's true he does seem to be like one of the nicest guys and then whatever they interview egipto we love you know yeah no offense but we just think you're a bad person in your life that will John's words not mine all right so then we see in the day spa the Jimmy is had a huge box of burner phones and moving to the back he is making an underworld and he's making the profit and I'll fit right profit off it not his store right they haven't yeah I mean that he's getting a bunch of sales you selling all those right right we're also seeing Jimmy is addicted to schemes like everything for him becomes a scheme any opportunity he gets he starts thinking how can I you know manipulate this we should take the phone call about school and then then whoever's on the phone pretty easily and then refuses to keep it really cracked me up because you know it seem like she's going to be the the the good cop of Ethics here and then she she she totally can be bought for the price of one burner just seen the armchair next to his bed just watching him wow the seen this seen honestly it's like if you if you couldn't watch the whole episode you only got to watch one scene this is the scene I mean this monologue that the dust delivers I guarantee you this monologue will be submitted for better call Saul's Emmy for next year this is the Amy scenes always remember could you not help yourself but think about you know how these two characters Fates and up colliding in in Gus's death later I mean I could not yeah I could not help but but think about how the tables turned at the end of life and what a what a a statement about how we never know how life is going to end up missing in the end ultimately Hector wins but he makes the decision for both of them that life is over if he had simply and when you get a chance perhaps Gus would have beaten Walt that's a that's a fair question to examined it's possible and it is seeing I have cute up so let us play that right now and then we'll discuss the Monarch the doctor tells me a fever has gotten worse I say this infection make you do even if it doesn't my doctor tells me again and again that you may never wank the ACT I wait that grew up quite poor we live in the Hills replace my brothers built from things around metal sheeting plywood it rained it's not like it you are always hungry but that was a lucuma tree scrawny barely alive my family had given up on it years before never bore fruit when I was 7 Xscape fixated on it I watered it send it to it it took a long time but the bond screw in the green fruit so proud I didn't tell anyone I ate the whole day I'd never tasted something so sweet it was like God a man at first we ate for ourselves and then I began taking it to the Village to sell one day much of the food was gone from my tree pieces were scattered on the ground half Ed I thought it was probably a quality have you ever seen one about the size of a large house cat opportunist what does the snare using branches in wire it didn't take long for the animal to set it off Kawaii Crush so hard he broke out of the snare you slag as well I tried to grab it but he slipped away and ran into the house we knew it would show itself sooner or later so I waited 4 hours into the night Clippers score for me I did not answer I didn't make sound it came out I knew I was there but he was hungry this time I was ready I caught it ittefaq me but I was Stronger the merciful thing would have been to be in it I kept it Hindi for quite some time I believe so good he explains that you know he he had heard that that she may never wake up but he believes he will only talks about his impoverished Chelsea said that they built the house with things they found and it smelled like hey and probably worse than that right like oh I'm sure the house that was built with just stuff they found that he found a tree that is going to give up because it wasn't it wasn't any fruit so he raised the tree we took a lot of pride in became obsessed with Reviving The Tree I think this is a great metaphor for his friend Max who you know Hector had killed which is as far as we know that the main reason for him wanting to get revenge on him when when when he you know shop in the head right next to him so I think it's you know the tree is that seemingly in love and they purposely never said whether or not they were or not and I think that's fine to leave things open like that obviously we can choose to believe what they believe I believe that for him wanting Revenge this bad for him seems to me that he had a love with Max that he was never able to recapture again this life yeah I think that that's sort of the tragic you know figure explained as you said they love love love on the show to show how people became the people that they are and where we're getting we have insight into that you know progress has eaten most of the fruit comparison to being classy right right listening Enid listen and let us know if he said that I was thinking the whole time of a coyote and I was surprised he even slept 4 hours into the night expecting you to come for some reason I don't know his his parents are I think that was new information I don't know that we knew that before this episode and he didn't listen to obsessed with us again is it 7 years old he was there but it came out and explained by the head he slowly tortured the animal better than killing it kept it alive for a long time torturing to death so you think about the signs of a kid torturing animals as a kid how that you know some of the psychological issues that you may have another good sign and you see that he had some of those not he was able to learn how to you know you also have high intelligence so I stopped him from becoming just so you know what a common murderer Seaford person like that what they say though those are the two main factors that contribute to someone becoming a sociopath is you know torturing animals as a child and high intelligence earth science factors signs yeah I love that movie Signs Mel Gibson exactly because really this whole thing is about Mel Gibson I mean it's all a metaphor for Mel Gibson let me just tell you I'm offended you would ever even ask because Mel Gibson is a God in the movie Signs Braveheart who even remembers that movie getting even remember I love you going to hear that people here. F4i I don't know Forrest Gump from God damn it this is the movie with the guy from Silicon Valley TJ Miller to mail the big sick little brain fart like I'm going to leave the conversation that we had right now out of nowhere about the movie so good it's really good movie I really like address of the group explains living situations house but one of Ziegler's men's and my tells a group they're worse being the one he's like anybody ever does to get the look from Mike quite a collective I hope I can remember that equality let's all take a vow that we're going to remember the word classy I may be plenty listeners like that was never heard of it before so I'm glad that I learn something it's like every time you learn something freaking new high is your blood ones aliens eyes are Blood Brother commit to this with you that I will remember glass word trying to straighten this guy out they would tell you doing what they're paying you not listen when he talks and he said once they start you know they started and Mike walks into an industrial trailer outside where they have guard watching the groups of security cameras myself to keep an eye on that guy that nights at the laundromat super easy mug $10 just to just to leave me alone is it you have to hassle him and said they demand everything he has one of them pulled out of switchblade these fucking kids idiots Jimmy runs away and the eustachian ever it turns out it is obvious that he was leading him into it into a truck into a penny is there an amazing cinematography but they look like they're straight-up because of and the camera also spins beautifully there's a bunch of the experiment with the freaking loved it and I feel like this was a great use of the guitar background yes yes which is now that you've explained what a great wink to the director as the two masked men busted with baseball bats did they have to pay for those cuz it was so he can afford to buy cheap pinatas Malone and then we knew was the one that was the whole time until until he took out the mass but that was such a fulfilling moment to to see if you will return some you can correct me if I'm wrong but I just face look skinny looks like he's much better he looks like he's slim down and it's it's I'm done talking about this morning and then leave them hanging in store yeah that's amazing all right let's get into the second let's do it kind of go over what episodes of the first one which is the worst decision is got to be on the part of these kids he fall for Jimmy's Russe it's like you don't even say that he gets there before they can find them in there like you like the stupidest guy ever I was like yeah yeah just going to the machine and unplugging it from the wall with Hector equally bad decision the lingering on his hand yeah yeah yeah that did you not just sit there waiting thinking that hands going to Twitch and beautiful language of Cinema right now so beautiful I mean I'm not a filmmaker so I can't say how hard it is but I just assumed from the lack of people to do it as eloquently as Better Call Saul on Breaking Bad that is just so few good place to take the time to explain something that I want somebody to give you a little bit and just with our knowledge of his you know before you start walking out before everybody else it meant so much more I think it's probably you know that the script might of said you know that we see his hand is is Gus walks out the door but my guess is that wasn't even in the script that's just good directing director saying you know what we're going to work in a rest camera on the hand and saying so I think that's probably a huge huge accomplishment of the director yeah exactly let's get to the funniest moment that's the funniest moment other week Howard Jimmy interaction I love when he's a fucking to music that's it that's exactly what I did was cute I decided for me the funniest moment was watching those kids in the pinata store upside down get there as I just that was I laughed out loud I'm let's get to the next one which is the best time of the week stay away from Gus's monologue yeah I like it too I did it for me I liked it I was good at it from yeah ouch yeah for me and it's kind of been on the nose line but I just I loved it and it's you know when Jimmy turns around to those kids and then tell them you should have took the deal I love that line so good now this wanted to use as part of my backup for my discussion from the opening sequence of the the purpose of the opening sequence I think the gym he's going to find out the Kim went to schweikart and that's going to be the final straw between them I think it's going to cause they're break up and then separating from each other the motivation of of impressing her was one of the reasons that you got and then you add the Doodles and him fantasizing about working with her which is all you wanted to do from the beginning was interrupted by check coming in the mail room and they were having a equals conversation about that equal and that that's going to be pretty tough to swallow and I think it's going to be the end between them I think that's the Ty Lee possible my prediction of the week is that on next week salamanca's going to wake up in the trailer not first thing I just heard that they did I was like the stuff that would have been a pretty cold open credits brilliant brilliant because he's been out for a couple months I would say how long he has until he can start practicing login as a timeline cuz we don't know really how long that is but I'm assuming he still has 9 months at least it's it's fair enough but I'm going to go out there and say nope he's waking up next week can I thank you again for coming along on this podcast and talking with me and
