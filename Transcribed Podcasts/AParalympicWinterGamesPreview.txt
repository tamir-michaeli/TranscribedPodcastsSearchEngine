Cloud Minnesota I'll be competing in boardercross and Banks slalom snowboard competitions in South Korea he wasn't able body Pro snocross in motocross racer Motocross is off-road motorcycle racing snocross is basically the same thing on a snowmobile the story of Howard Schultz got to be a paralympic hopeful actually starts 10 years ago I had the championship snocross qualifier into the second round of the national tour which was December 13th 2008 it was Ironwood Michigan That season 8 I started with a new race team and new snowmobile manufacturer and you know it's just motivated to do really well and obviously we had some some Growing Pains getting set up on brand new equipment for me she was going into the first qualifying event of the weekend and he needed to finish in the top five to move on to the main race lighter day the course included a series of steep downhill runs and a heads-up to listeners Schultz describes what happens next in pretty graphic terms and I want to make a move about halfway through and my snowmobile started swap in side to side and and I got pissed off I landed on my left leg with all my weight as my knee was fully extended shelter the race the impact of the landing had snapped his leg at the knee compound fracture and got some some severe damage to my nerves and main artery that supply that so I was I was bleeding out on the side of the racetrack I mean at that moment I knew I was in really serious condition or shattered we went to the first hospital which wasn't equipped to handle my situation so I had to get transferred he couldn't get a better equipped hospital because snow storm was approaching and what and helicopters were grounded so after the 2-hour ambulance ride to the second Hospital Shelton lost even more blood all because of my lack of blood pressure so I just kind of had to grin and bear it the first day and a half at the hospital or two days or so kind of Fades together at this point yeah they did a total of 5 surgery was so helpful the doctors would be able to save his leg. I had no idea that happy Tatian was was going to be the outcome I assume that they could just bolted all back together and 610 weeks later or maybe a little bit longer I be able to start my rehab and and start working back into shape again it woke me up after another surgery in my entire family was in the room and I could tell something was a little off now that I was in bad physical condition and not too far away from not even making it through so doctor came in and he proceeded to explained it to me the the challenges and problems that that I was facing so at that point he's like we think it would be the best plan of action to amputate your leg just above the knee in order for you to survive hearing that yeah that I just gave me shivers and it was a punch to the gut and I had no idea that that was going to be the outcome of it I mean I thought it was just another bad knee injury she'll spend another 2 weeks in the hospital recovering after the amputation when he returns home he had to adjust to a new way of living Southern or like walking into a three-story house and steps and icy sidewalks and all that and sick while this is is going to be a challenge. Tube undergone limb amputation excruciatingly painful phantom pain for several weeks afterwards which was more extreme than the initial injury pain how they explained it to me is my nerve endings aren't hooked up so my brains not sure which signals to read from those and they just send pain signals for example one of the worst ones felt like my my foot was was getting crushed by a vice like the first week or two I couldn't even sleep experiment with the long list of medicines and therapies to find a way to live with and manage his pain he's just getting back out on the snow help speed is recovery I actually got back on my snowmobile before I even had a prosthesis got back into the gym and in exercising and feeling a little bit better about life and got on my first prosthesis five and a half weeks after the injury that first prosthesis was plastic and temporary and it fit onto his Limb and then there was a mechanical leg attached to it and then a carbon-fiber foot underneath it actually walked out of my first fitting that was the happiest guy in the world that moment I was up right again I could use my hands I didn't have to be holding crutches anymore be able to seriously compete on a bike or on a snowmobile with a prosthesis on my everyday walking leg in the thing just flops around cuz there's no spring resistance helping to hold my way. So soon as I would put weight into it he would just Flex just go to a sporting shoe store and you'll see that there are shoes for dads and their shoes for wrestling and their shoes for boxing and their shoes for running and their shoes for running on the track versus doing a marathon at the University of Pittsburgh the same is true if you have a lower extremity prosthetic then you have to have one for walking and another one for running and you might have to have another one for jumping for rock climbing or bicycling because the task is different gated specifically for that activity until recently the options for prosthetics for limited but that's changed and the impact is huge says dr. Cooper in the paralympic games for example in Rio on the winter sports side their sled hockey which was introduced in 1994 and Snowboard introduced in 2014 Michael of Ukraine wins gold Oksana masters of the US the silver her first paralympic winter Metairie time paralympian Oksana Masters remembers when she made her transition from every day walking Prosthetics to the high-tech limb she currently wears called the x 3 x 3 is a waterproof above-the-knee prosthetic leg with micro processing chips that can sense of changing to rain and adjust the amount of resistance in the knee Masters is a double above-the-knee amputee both of her x-rays cost about $300,000 in total I will never forget the first time I could walk with it open cup full of liquid and not Splash it Masters trains in her Prosthetics but unlike Mike Schultz she doesn't wear them to compete in adaptive para Nordic skiing she uses a Sit ski to propel herself she won two medals in pair of cross country skiing in Sochi in 2014 when she was 24 years old I have an athlete I've taken my legs off because I'm at. well above the knee and it's really hard when you're missing for joints Tunisian to ankles I have my first leg amputated when I was 9 and my second one when I was 14 and they thought they would be able to save my right leg but the way I taught myself how to walk on that leg when I was a little girl basically blew out that night and it was just started growing out sideways because of the height difference between my two legs Master said she originally got into rowing as a form of therapy when I was in that hospital bed and couldn't get out that's the one thing I was gravitating to is the minute I'm able to get out of this bed I am not going to stop I'm going to go out and I'm going to roll and I'm never going to come back in the doc and come back on land Masters went on to win bronze and Rowing at the London Paralympics in 2012 she's hopeful that advancements in Prosthetics technology will Propel the next generation of para-athletes to go even further that young little girl that Leon little boy who is 7 or 5 or 13 and wants to do the same thing that he was doing he can Jump Right In he doesn't have to wait for that technology to advance and ever have to wonder like will I be able to do this coming up after a break will hear how paralympian Mike Schultz built a company around his prosthetic design and how that design landed him a spot on the Paralympics snowboarding team we live in New York City so before we leave the house everyday I do a quick Alexa what's the weather but I also love good sound quality which is why I'm So Into Sonos one the newest addition to the Sonos home sound system it's not just a speaker it's the speaker the premium wireless sound system controlled by your voice which I love this is for the people who love sound when I first got it I was thinking I have to set up this going to take a while but all I did was go to the link download the app right to my phone in the whole thing really just come in at the speaker it's surprisingly small it ones right into the wall and you can choose a color that also blends with your Decor you can play Amazon music you can play Spotify Apple music all in one place and plus you can play different music in each room so I kids can listen to Kidz Bop in one room and I don't want to hear it and I can listen to Katy Perry on Sonos is offering listeners of the podium podcast 10% off one order of $2,500 or less for any product on Sonos.
