HowWeHireatNetflix
we are Netflix for Curious people that enjoy what we create a Netflix this podcast explores how the company operates did conversations between colleagues Mike Jones study biochemistry at Berry College in Rome Georgia then received a Bachelor of Science in marketing and Supply Chain management from the College of Business Administration at the University of Tennessee Knoxville has a long career including rolls at ATP is station and AT&T and Mike's first hr-related roll was a technical recruiter at Google in Austin then moved on to a three-and-a-half-year stint at Facebook folks and recruiting and Fry was engineers in about 8 months ago Mike join Netflix as a technical recruiting researcher Mike Jones thanks for joining us thank you if course I would be here if I send that to change the I change the name of an accent over to something but I see you have on your LinkedIn profile and also diversity Macy's at point of contact you so was that part of your role yes so it was a it was a project that I took on I was kind of indefinite where I was just wants will for essentially leading the charge for the rest of your crew eating for probably less I'm assuming it's a very hard Topic in the Silicon Valley right cuz like 80% white guys is like a pretty serious problem we have in Tech right Chrissy running studied organizational Communication business management and public relations at Washington State University Chrissy has worked in hiring at Aerotek Aerotek Aerotek engineering Tesla Motors and Yahoo almost 3 years ago Chrissy join Netflix and you don't have a staff including so Chrissy running thank you for joining us for you it's an easy transition because all of our managers here still recruits were so Hands-On versus a lot of companies you get really removed once you step into a manager role so it Netflix it's more of an easy transition but it is hard because you want to give your team opportunities and see jumping into doing everything yourself so I'm still finding that happy balance so touched on the varsity is that a hard-working how do you try to deal with getting a mortgage verse how do you work on that allows it comes down to really understanding why diversity is important you know that's the key to really getting everybody on board and industrially understanding that hey if you're building a company where your product is essentially the world need your employees actually reflect who your customer base is going to be starting from that is you know that is really important point to get people motivated to do you know taxi dig deep in and search for there for that you know if we're that Talent since it is you know since it is it's definitely missing here in the a.m. in the Bay Area and the texting ours to become more diverse so that we represent our audience better is that is that like a a real mission of ours or is that more like it feels right to do that that's an added bonus I think the end goal is to have it first team because you want diapers thought you want people that couldn't solve problems in different ways so I think that it's really understanding what is diversity mean you know even if you hired 5 people that all looks differently from an appearance standpoint but they all went to Stanford and major in the same thing and then they all went on to work at Google how diverse is your team so I think it's taking it a step further and understanding from managers like what is diversity mean to you and when I ask managers at Netflix I get really different and interesting answers first answers podcast over the years and it's because it says it's this very challenging problem because there's this large base of on people graduating oil pipeline that that whole argument thing which is a little misleading to the real problem but I think that that core aspect of like it's beneficial for the business is a key point to start with because we're not doing that you're just making yourself look better like you have to understand that it's important level Tab vs. Which means people from all different backgrounds and areas do you think we're doing well in some of these large corporations have that kind of diversity documents they publish and kind of be proud of themselves on the back I mean I know that we're doing badly only in as much as I know all the people at work here and it's still not representation of the human population of the planet Oregon California but do you feel like we're getting better at this I think we're getting better at it because we're educating herself on different ways to explore it and why it's important to your point it's not just let Tire diverse people so that we can get our numbers up and look good it's why is it important how do we find these people and so approaching it from that I see us getting better I also think that the way that we approach diversity is different and more genuine then a lot of companies you know a lot of companies just hire a diversity and inclusion manager and they're in charge of hiring diversity for the whole company and at Netflix we saved everyone's job and so not you know we're always doing things to better educate ourselves so we have unconscious bias training for our whole team we've had a few of those we have another one coming up this next month the engineering teams do it as well so it's not only how do we get these people in the door but then how do we make them happy how do we create an inclusive environment where they want to stay where they want to recommend their friends and so I think that just threw education we're continuing to get better but it's not like flipping light switch it's going to take time and I think they will see the results of the next 5 years I'm going to starts off with that with the statement that just seems so I really don't like recruiters Michael to have you had that experience I never get annoying emails were people just assume I can't wait to leave a full-time position for a contract position get those on Tuesday I bet that feeling of mine actually stems from the.com era when it was just everybody want you could if you could type option pewter you know you were needed and so there was really nasty tactics being used and I still see a bit of that I am of course being the flipping I don't really feel that way in fact in the last 5 years or so I felt that the the contact I've gotten from recruiter even just blind contact has been a lot better maybe it's cuz they got for knowledge about who I am I from my LinkedIn profile whatever or maybe the the just the area has become a more particular Cravings become a more defined Grim discipline is better train people in the environment assuming that's that the reason I would definitely say so that and the competition has gotten significantly better so if you get a blind reach out that just says I saw your experience and I think you'd be great you know let's chat and has a reference to nothing that you've done in the past you're less likely to respond to that one where if I send you a message that says hey I seen your career you know I'd like the work that you did. Netflix or right you know your previous company and I really think you'd be a great fit for this role because of XYZ or at least more apt to respond to that and if I send something out to you that was just blind that seem like it was a robot blasting out to a thousand people is this the unsolicited messages say hey we have this awesome in position you know you should come work here and I'm like wow you didn't even yeah she didn't even open my profile and I think that's what separates a good or a bad one it's it's really more quality approach over quantity approach I assume that the job at hiring at Netflix as for engineers is a lot easier than other companies not specifically because the play the job when you're that just that the Netflix name has this kind of excitement people excited about the term when I wear Swagger around as soon as I get excited about that and I'm assuming that's true for an engineer even if they're very happy at the roller Google or AT&T or wherever they are I'm assuming that they go talk to you is that true think so Netflix it a little easier but it's still quite difficult especially going up against some of our large competitors so I I definitely wouldn't say It's Easy by any means but it kind of spark this this thing in people's minds like hey I haven't been reached out to anybody from Netflix where as you know larger company you may have been resolved to buy it you know 10 recruiters you know talking about the same job I get a lot of responses saying like wow it's it's nice to hear from somebody at you know I'd like to know ya let's hop on a call in and I might not be interested but you know let's unite I'm interested to hear when you know what you guys have going on in and you know where the future going to take you engineer you're reaching out to so if we're talking about video streaming if we're talking about you I I think that people are very interested when were talking about device specific more in fetid software engineering rolls I a lot of the time will get wow I didn't know that Netflix did so much work on different devices and I didn't think about Netflix for you know embedded game consoles or set-top boxes in that sort of thing so I think it's summer guards UI engineering for example is in a really great job of branding the work that they do and so they almost created like a community outside of Netflix and then I think on the other side of the house and some of our teams we still have work to do to explain the world like what we do with devices might so so what's the pitch on better devices what do you say millions of devices depends on the type of engineer I'm talking to development for chips or something I hope you're ready for this I'm speaking on Spotify sure no no no it's great so I'll give you an example for like Mike and I are working on a security roll where we're looking for people who can essentially work with all the different partners so what do you think about the oh yeah all the people that build actual devices is so we're looking for an engineer who can actually review the code for these different partners for the products that they're building so that we can make sure that it's devices that are built in a way that will stream Netflix Mystic your way and so it's really awesome because he's Engineers are actually influencing the way that different devices are built down to the chip level that act like TVs yes this is called an RDP Netflix ready devices platform is kind of like an operating system that we build our app on and we make a whole SDK for the manufacturer like any TV manufacturer LG TV in front of me right now LG or Sony we give them this big kit they install it in their TV and get it running and I will process of course the whole Ginger and they have to do and we check it and make sure it works and of course when we get a unit from them we help them all on the process and then it's some point their system is ready in and thumbs up and ready to go and then we can play or app on their system and that's how Flex icon shows up on your TV effectively so that whole process means that oh if I'm been working in a manufacturing company for a long time doing it but it ship design stuff could be very useful roll at Netflix engaging with those types of people at LG you would ever actually demoing it if you walk around you'll see a whole bunch of pcbs on standoffs which are the next version of the greatest TV that's about to come out. By the way what is OEM original engineering equipment manufacturer we got the key somebody cuz I got you do that kind of stuff so that's a bit of a barrier but in general I'm assuming that special in the area cuz week or solar engineering efforts are in Silicon Valley still do any LG phones that are adult content content in what's the story that's different here Google are hiring Yahoo how is a different thing than a minute about the most of our teams are really really lean compared to it you know compared to a lot of our competitors so if you come here you're going to own a really really large chunk of what it is that you work on and we're going to put all of the the trust in you that you're going to let you know you're going to get all this done because the great thing about being at a large companies if you don't get something done probably it's on you or doesn't get done someone having ownership for a lot more ownership over what it is that they're working on is a big pool for them actually let a project that was kind of started up in engineered focused very different than you'll see in a situation where the 3M people work in the same thing I don't want to be in this this machine. I haven't seen that just yet but if so that's probably a bad sign so but I mean even me personally I ate the background is this done by close to a hundred where is here it's it's kind of you know myself and and you know what a recruiter working with me on the on the rolls and you know that's pretty much it so even from that standpoint ownership that I have now of the entire process in the entire pipeline is night and day from from what it was for me in the past was it scary for you it was it was in our our director kind of gave me a warning before I coming in and she she she told me he might look and Lynn loves when I tell the story because she always happens to be over my shoulder when I'm telling it a day at a happy hour or something but she told me he might do you know if you're going to come in here we're going to pay you well and that you're probably going to work significantly harder I was like I don't know what you're talking about and then I was like oh right you know what what progress have we had because there's no one else doing it so you're the only one moving the needle so I see I was there it was a big change with more responsible and ownership I find the for the ladder right I feel like my actual hours are kind of comprable to have always worked have always been kind of somebody got things done but the actual ownership level of responsibility is little different so you feel more empowered Baltimore Swan yeah I think so in the end you're going to have more impact but also it kind of forces you to have to work a lot more efficiently to get the same job done or it's the larger job done and in the similar amount of time so working efficiently it was was one of my challenges starting off but yeah the right then you know our our our notion of a of a real-time feedback that was something that was presented to me a number of times and you know it really you know really kind of help me zero in on exactly where I was wasting time and where I could be more efficient with my time on a daily basis so it it definitely helped out I was just I was pretty happy at the time that Facebook you know is just add the fear of the unknown early and being you know I'm taking on the responsibility of of something that again there's no no there's no one to fall back on specifically is like the one point person for iOS engineer hiring here or is it that deal with that kind of role you say I need this kind of people I need to be no cure or I needed to nearest whatever they're they're needed and you're having to feel all this I'm assuming that means you are a big part of your role is kind of building up and I'm a space what's possible to carry that what people do you want me to have contacts for it's a lot of light collection of kind of relationships that we can then take advantage of the fortune late to say that that way rather than contact person without being being cold so how do you how do you Foster getting that information and collecting see what does it look like from a like if I watched over your shoulder will be doing sure so a lot of it you know it comes down to just really figuring out if I if I come across the canadan I see that they're connected with you know what some of the some of the team members here reaching out to the team members in saying hey you know what can you reach out to this person claim somebody let's see if this person and you know you do you agree with you know you agree that they should you know they should be here at Netflix you know do you mind do you mind making an introduction so that at least we can hop on the phone because obviously an introduction coming from you is much better than then I completely cold meat out for me as personalize it may be so I work with mobile all the time I got this my space and I see really great people not a lot of people leaving a lot of work being done why do we need someone dedicated full-time to hire more engineers in Mobile what's the solution what am I not getting my surprise I'm pretty but a lot of the companies in the in the Bay Area and I do want to expand globally and so in order to do that a lot of people use mobile predominantly to listen to music to watch movies and watch content and so when we think about expanding globally mobile is a huge huge priority for us it's also a really really hard skill set to hire for because everyone else is hiring mobile specifically Android cuz around the world a lot of people use Android but it's the US most get Michael picked up his Android device is in in the US it's the the market with highest saturation iOS compared to Android other markets normally Android leads which makes it difficult to find those Android Engineers to do some of the global work that we're trying to do cuz I've got jobs this year but our goal is to have a waiting list to get into Netflix I mean we want a brand ourselves and be the company that people think about when they say where do I want to work next does that mean that you were talking to people about and such you might go oh that's person I want to talk to me again in 6 months or a year you might be thinking I they probably join us in the next 5 years at some point is that the kind of absolutely and so to kind of go back to your initial question that was you know what would it look like if I looked over your shoulder a lot of our job is you know getting to the warmest leads or candidates that are familiar with Netflix so maybe they have attended an event maybe they say they will listen to a podcast maybe we've had dinner with them before and so getting to those people first and in fact sometimes those conversations lead to an opportunistic higher so Mike just hired someone on the Android team that we don't we don't even have a job opening right now but she came in she killed in the interview and it was like why would we not hire this purse did she accept the offer she did so I said we we Hi-5 Hi5 there on the office yesterday but of course in the in the in the world that mobile recruiting there was an offer already on the table with some with some pressure coming down on here so you know soon as it was definitely challenging especially in the I'm in the Android space Android or are you guys hiring at 200 director just going to give a quick shout-out to Mike too because it offers stage with another company I think she would actually verbally accepted another offer and Netflix got her an interview and gave her an offer the same day while she was on site so we I think the difference between us and Company is this we can really hustle for someone that were excited about the surprise make it felt like that and it feels like the better way to do that of course is to Look Alot potentials the same time but of course that takes more work and all that so I can go somewhere else if someone talks to me that same time a lot of those questions I've already have answered I'm decided to leave so now it's really the session by where I want to go so it seems like a pretty time to do that of course that other company there people in your same rules trying to get that person to this little bit of pressure there how do you make sure that she made the right decision so a lot of info on on salmon and Bianca Rosa back in recruiter I think would help us in this situation was taking more of the consultative approach and end to sing like hey we know we really want you to find what the best place for use going to be in if it's not Netflix and that's okay rather than absolutely right absolutely but we're the last metrics-driven then you know them than most companies out there and most innermost recruiting organization send it specifically set up that way so that we aren't trying to fit you know what a circle into a square you know it's where whole you know we want somebody to come here because they want to be here and they want to stay for a long time and will fit well good job to be here to go somewhere else company in 3 or 4 years might have the same conversation with her and by that time should be like that they really help me out absolutely it is important to have a real relationship rather than just that I think when it comes to want to come to evaluating offers and are you looking at spending the next C Note 3 to 5 to 10 years of your life I think it's important to have everything on the table so that you can really make the best decision for yourself and in your family if you have one so that when you do land here you know alright you know I made the right decision I knew all of my options were on the table where I knew what my options were when I feel like I made the right choice you know without you know without any crazy pressure from Mom from any recruiters as well as we're not measured by how many people we extend offers to and the reason we do that is because if I'm partnering with the hiring manager I need to be there Consulting and I need to be able to poke holes and stay like you know if you only have one opening for the rest of the year is this the person that you want what are the rest of hiring this person would you be disappointed if they join another company and I think our our business partners really appreciate that and so we never want to be held in metrics because we don't want to feel like we're all the Gated to make a fire if we always want to do what's best for the company and ask for the candidate and so we are able to generally say like I get paid the same regardless of whether you come right my job is not a Little Liars exactly let's talk about the pros and cons of you joining Netflix let's talk about your reservations talk about where you want to be in 5 years from now and I really appreciate that cuz we've all had those calls with a recruiter where we just feel like we're being cool so I think and it's really appreciate that and to your point we do have people that will call us two weeks later are your letter and say hey I made a huge mistake I want to come to Netflix Chrissy how if if you're not looking at metrics are you know Mike's Bikes doing a good job because we have a culture of open feedback and so I know that he's doing a good job when I hear managers come to me and say wow I'm so impressed with the way Mike Taylor's every message to these candidates I can see how many candidates are responding to Mike and that is response rate is really high considering the type of Engineers he's going to candidates it will say you know I joined because of Mike and he made the process so comfortable for me so I think just keeping it real with Mike in and telling the things he's really excelling and then say Oh shoot okay I needed to hear that you always had those conversations and then that allows him to pay for it and make changes and and get better really quickly probably 360 feedback is a once-a-year event that we get everybody rallied around the idea that constructive feedback will make everyone at the company better and so everyone gets an opportunity to tell any other co-workers Partners on other teams hey here are areas in which I see you excelling your areas in which I think you should stop doing this behavior and here are areas that I think you should start doing a behavior that I would say that the way in which we do this feedback is traditionally written about a lot of teams are team for example of does it verbally so we give it to each other real-time 360s real-time performance piece to clarify it to Michael saying that we do that real feedback all the time for taking and giving feedback each other so we can order of the year and then and that's kind of like brushing your teeth is is the analogy used and that the 360 process where we write it down as more likely visit ask a vet clinic so it's kind of to help you keep that I Jane going of being really clear and give 10 feedback I think it's kind of amazing he sure is a long time you notice the change in the good ways because of your feedback which is weird to see you like I almost don't almost don't believe it when it happens like yeah that persons not doing that anymore its neighbors all day if you will let me tell you want to ask you like because you're because we got a manager and employee relationship if you give feedback it was hard to hear so hard to give this time around it you want to share with the world to each other or just in general which other cuz it's the two-sided thing is kind of interesting process but I also don't want we can spot I was on maternity leave so I didn't get as much but I think I just might feedback so he's comfortable sharing he can the common theme of of my feedback was don't be afraid to hop in I found myself pretty hesitant to tutor really dive in and uses Frozen and you know it in resources that I've gained over there then over the past couple of years with in rear over my career and I was was so used to asking for permission rather than just stopping in in any kind of doing what I do in my head was right but I was so used to getting you know getting a check mark like okay now you know so it wasn't it wasn't the first time I heard in it and that's the point you know of a real-time feedback I hate this shouldn't be the first time that you're hearing and if so something was wrong along the way and then somebody should have spoken up in and set it in itialy it was refreshing to hear because the wall uncomfortable to some extent it was refreshing to hear and and to know that hey this is feedback that I've gotten before in along in a bundled up within that that feedback as well it said you don't pay we we've seen you make progress like it's you know you're doing great but you know keep going so even though a lot of people to talk to or people that know some it would Netflix cuz it's kind of that aspect is also the kind of cold call how do you guys try to explain this I think it's the way the Netflix business work is very different than most businesses and responsibilities what that actually means inside the how do you present that to people that don't you start that dialogue I had a lot of conversations about this before he doing trying to explain it but it is really hard you know you almost have to to come in and experience it yourself it's tough down here which I attended a Netflix happy hour prior to coming on board and Chrissy asked at some point you know what you have plan to off here and the stair that I got from her like I felt like reached out of my soul and she's like where you were before I got here oh my gosh and offer offer was signed already and she said hey if you if you don't start taking if you don't start taking more vacation we're going to have that we're going to have someone who wants about why is it so important for you that employees take vacations but I'm but not it was it was great because it really encourages you to take time to recharge I definitely appreciate it and it was a story that I told the family she described me to take my vacation or else we're going to have issues and then I'll know what's funny I actually had a one-on-one with them with one of our team members are Bianca yesterday and she said so you've got to stop taking these Three Days Inn at least three day or 1801 one day and then we can vacation she's like when you going to take two weeks off and I was like oh so we literally sat down and looked at my calendar and said alright this is probably the week that you should go do it so I'll help ya to get out of the office you got to relax and self Netflix loss if he is essentially we're not tracking how many hours you spend in the office or that you spend answering emails and so we're not going to check the time that you spend on vacation and I think it's not only important Mike to recharge and for myself to recharge but the example that it sends to everyone else and so we all know those people who never take vacations and then it can spiral it can become you know where everyone think so because of a senior recruiter at the senior manager doesn't take vacation it means I can't take vacation and so I think it's just good to hold our peers accountable and our colleagues accountable because really you know what you doing courage each other and so when I join Netflix I was interviewing and and my manager said oh you got to interview on these days cuz I'm going to be a bottle rocket. But I thought that's cool and then she went to extend the offer and she said you got to accept by this date because I'm going camping with my family and I'm not going to have cell phone service for a week and a half just came back from a thing for three weeks with my husband and I'm like but really you know she's a mom of four and family comes first and so for me and I love having that example of someone who spends time with her family set time to recharge but also when she's at the office you know just kills it in her job because the judge me on if I'm doing this right I say first off if you've found yourself in jobs where your little frustrated people not picking up the ball and doing things that's a good sign that you fit here because everybody does. And another Eyeworks education for a long time and wonderful people some really amazing things but of course the core goal of university is really admirable but it was definitely time for I'm like wow I have to compensate resentment because I be doing all this work cuz I wanted to get it done and other people weren't you don't have that problem here so I kind of lean on that like what do you look like over the career do you have to be told what to do are you kind of do you start dilly dally and not doing the work because I think distracts you that's not a good sign and that's really just more of that I know some people will thrive in this environment and if some people will not this motivational like moving from a being told what to do YouTube being molded you by yourself the one responsible you have is an employee here is to change yourself to do that that's hard to do how do you decide to do that how do you do it I think a lot of it comes down to really odd looking around at your peers in and realizing that they're doing the same and I think a lot of the day motivation comes from you know sitting in a meeting and being like wow I'm going to push myself to do you know the be more like this person because you know because that's where I want to be in my career you know in a year 2 years from now so I think a lot of it comes from release looking on the table and and seeing you know how much you know that the great work that our peers are doing and Andrea you know a lot of it comes from that that kind of pure motivation there to make sure that you get the job done it again if you don't you know the ball is kind of yours so if you know if the ball is dropped there really aren't many people who will can I can pick it up behind you it's kind of pay raise kids to be independent and some ways right like I'll do it again can I hear from my manager directly was really cool to hear that the need for us to focus on that empowering diversity and ivory processor part of a worker so that's great the other aspect we have this kind of problem attic and Engineering space is this idea of how you judge whether a person has the qualifications to do the job and this is not mean they have a bachelor's degree in science or whatever I don't have a degree in computer science Michael do you oh yeah Montana State University just an FYI anyone for Montana please come out but what we do is we find people are interested in being here and they come into pipeline processes how big businesses work and that person put in a room with a couple people that quiz them with a whiteboard how do you make a linked list you know what to think people here I can't tell you what we do here if you guys need but we kind of know that this process doesn't really achieve the goal that it's supposed to achieve and yet I still see it happened here Netflix if someone like you made a comment about someone out and understanding prototype of prototypical chain recently so I'm not convinced that we're doing that part of it well and that's not your role cuz the hiring manager but do you guys have you been researching and looking at it and seeing what the better tactics there are to help improve are hiring managers on the process and flow absolutely that we have with managers because our job is to get the best people in the door and part of that is how do we assess who are we assess dating are we setting them up for Success so I think a common misconception in the industry is it you have to have those kind of like got your questions right but that's not realize and realize you were given all the context you're given time and then you're you execute until I think that taking a step back and approaching recruiting from that lens is like so if we give these people to contacts going into it what are the risks is different from other job if I can so just riding challenging managers to think that way the other thing coming back to diversity is so common thing I see is managers wanting to do a 10:15 hour take home exercise is a mom I do not have 10 hours after work to go home and do a 10-hour exercise and so if you're expecting your candidate to do these exercises outside of an interview or these like take-home assignment you may be only appealing to one side of the audience or you know perhaps you have a man and a woman they both do the exercise the woman spends 3 hours that she has the man spends 15 and therefore you get different outputs to one solution to that is I've been doing exercise on site and instead of having them do some crazy you know computer science fundamental type got you a question why don't you have them work on something that would be similar to what they would actually work on here and give them the context about like this is what we do here this is why it's important here's how we built this that's a very hard thing to do to get right I feel like we probably are more selective than we need to from a technical perspective because I came from a self-taught and I've had to learn a lot here even though I'm a senior it was hired as a senior some Curious do you guys watch the process in the hiring flow do you take a look and you sit in the meanings of whiteboards to do that kind of stuff not easy on site technical interviews just because it would just go way over my head with each kind of that comes in we we typically will will do a debrief you know what the entire team and really just discuss how each interview went in and really dig down and if we if we find out that hey if we're doing X and we're just seeing that you know 99% of the candidates aren't making it through maybe we should take a step back and you know in NC is this you know is this the right way to go about evaluating the salad can anybody pass it you know what about the aspect of when you find someone you guys are like Elvis Presley amazing like you know they're there at Apple they did some iOS development app Apple in the operating system and they're being hired on iOS team as if it's a process and then they went to the Whiteboard and they failed and then I can see that problem and go wait a second let's let's read this is higher than any way and yeah I kind of thing often times it's they're coming from a large company and haven't had quite the ownership there were looking for so that's I'm saying is you know there's a hundred and fifty other people working on this one tiny piece of the pie and when we are interviewing someone to technical skills are important yes but it's also how do you work cross-functionally how do you defend your ideas how do you show up in meetings how do you end of a time so all of those things could be reasons why these people would be disqualified if it does really seem like a technical mess in this person did let's say worked at startups how to ownership in and it really should have been a slam dunk I think that just talking to the manager and the team like where did we miss right where do we think things went wrong here and on to your point while I think asking the questions of okay they miss these few questions how long would it take someone to learn this what's the time that it would take the ramp because if this role is going to take us six or seven months to hire on and find the right person someone can ramp up in a month maybe it's worth the investment looks great and all other ways so let's get in 3 months and we talked about this I have been for a while so we would it work look like for all you are one big thing is we we emphasize communication as a large party is being on Lui we're not on any individual team we are simply a team that has to integrate with all other teams and so are often a conduit for communication and not necessarily the most technically challenging problems and so that makes things different makes it a little bit harder so that means our algo portion of the interview is definitely not something that I've gotten at other places it's definitely easier and harder at the exact same time our take home is now reduced we can only tell people not to really spend more than 5 hours on it you should be spending a little more time it's about Defending Your Ideas and how to extend it may have live exercises of extending or trying to alter it so that if someone comes in and they're technically confident and great communication they'll more likely achieve getting onto ouyi then say if you're really really awesome at algorithms like we recently had an interview or someone's really awesome algorithms but they're communicating what if I depart anything right yeah like if you ask him to make a linked list they'll ask for single or double I feel he's just really really on on point but communication may be lacking in that is more of a concern for a team in which your kind of dictating all these other teams experience it's right. We just completed hiring two people so we're kind of went through that process what was the act like how many how many people came in for me know what does positions versus how many actually interviewed interesting fact that the two people that we did hire I did not interview so maybe there is a little something there apparently I just say no but you don't often I think any good company that you're trying to hire a quote on quote All Stars you're not you're missing a hundred out of it when is my assumption it's not easy if it's the analogy is sports teams that only very few out of a thousand actually ever get anywhere near there and so I think that's somewhat similar here but Recruiting Office in Lee filters out most of that and so when they come on site there more likely for Success event weather for here I think I know. Can we do we do a Dream Team ignore all sports oh I didn't know that that we don't strive for ya so a lot of times you know hiring managers will say thank you for your feedback I'm going to take the bet you know it where it's very different from most companies where you get maybe an average score and that score either leads to higher or no higher so I've seen it where where most people on the interview panel Rhino and we still hire the people in their great and so ultimately I'm going back to you know freedom of responsibility and what does it look like on a day-to-day basis at Netflix hiring managers have the freedom to hire people that they believe are going to be successful you know regardless of the feedback that they get from their team it's important data points but it's it's not the deciding factor whether things I ever called doing in my interview process is afterwards when talking with the hiring manager Maxine I'd mention my Prada the process and where I went when it went okay and where also cave cave feedback to the team members that I'm at and who I thought kind of in a question that and I think that kind of guy should talk about this but I think I kind of lied to her thinking how he's thinking in a broader sense not just about the job is doing that myself so I think the qualities of just figuring out of a person's going to be there is pretty complex okay so you touched on earlier that you guys look at bias training implicit bias and I want to talk a little bit about bias because the hiring process of course that's the fault to some degree is if you go well I'm going to put this person in empty room and the ability to do something and or they're going to interview them for an hour about how they feel the biases of the people they're interviewing play a major part in this so understanding your own implicit bias is critical to getting that out of the picture as much as possible that we really can't so how do you say it is that something we do here we do a lot of training on the first bus explain it I think it's really important just to the we're never going to get rid of what are biases but the biggest part is is really identifying it and an understanding it in and still being able to make the right decision with you know what that in mind and I support have done it as well and so when you go through the training it basically you know you're having to make really quick decisions on this or that one right or left right or left and so you do this fast as you can buy presents you with your biases and then it's the training is basically like now that we know that's what we do with it and so I think teaching people just to acknowledge their own biases helpful because then you can actually sit down and say how do I feel about this person or it allows you to approach a call with knowing this is my bias how am I going to approach this call differently and so it's not perfect I think interviewing a superficial the way it's set up right you're judging someone and a half day or an hour or 30 minutes but trying to make the most of those conversations in a way that maybe highlights their experience differently then you know just asking those stand questions is in our process even in a sense by a slimming kind of explain the side that I I I can't speak for how the world and how different cultures actor behave but we are looking for people with whom have kind of independent type Spirit where they want to run with projects they want to be the lead they want to do all these things and so naturally there is going to be I don't I don't know if the whole world operates that sound like people who want to accomplish things whether they're hard or easy I don't know if that's the right way to put like they want to be the person who pushes across the Finish Line like there are just a whole set of people that aren't like that I went to school as a CS major there's a lot of people like that just to NCS in general I think that you're absolutely right and so often times, if you looked at our culture and ask questions like the the question that comes up all the time and interviews is like talk about feedback you've given or received a lot of people aren't in environments radar comfortable giving feedback or B they just never been in environment and so I think you can't just eliminate someone because of that okay Michael you haven't been in an environment where you were encouraged to give feedback what about your personal life or what about another times of your life or given what you know about the Netflix culture how would you approach that that situation differently Karen what feedback would you have given so allowing them the opportunity to explain it and if someone hasn't done that it's okay but I think then there needs to be a conversation about okay Michael you haven't worked in an environment where it's been you know who encouraged to give and receive feedback let's talk about how we're going to work on getting you there so that you can be set up for 6 that's when you join and so I think it's okay that people haven't done everything that were talking about in our culture but being really upfront and honest about it that's why we're making it happen because we will feel like the culture here is really great and not even necessarily to work here but just to spread this way of doing business I'd like to see that spread I think a couple years ago read to the stage in Rivard County meetings was like important things here we're going to do really great swing video and run a business that operates in the way we operate from you said on stage that he feels like I said really important aspect of what we're doing so how do you pitch it how do you share with people what the fundamentals actually are that's that stuff I mean you know that the biggest thing in it again I'll go back to this is really pissing on Michigan and I think we hear freedom and responsibility so often hear that it we kind of become numb to it but I'm coming here from a Holter that freedom responsibility with this was kind of preach but it wasn't really bad. I think that's a huge huge selling point here describe describe and most of it was just saying hey don't do it don't do anything stupid you know like I appreciated one of the one of the points in it where it said on you know I hate we don't have any particular teams that are going to audit your travel expenses or anything like that messengers of Netflix that's a piece that really sunk in with me is is hey no one's telling me exactly what to do but I should do you know I should act in the best interest of the company and and nobody's going to be there behind you to dinner to approve an expense report or hey why did you fly first class here like if you if you feel like you need to do it then do it so having that freedom is is huge but also if you cross the line you know obviously I think you know having that balance in and making sure that that you are making the right choices and you know you were hired here for a reason you're an expert in your space but also making sure that you know that that you're able to have to balance at Freedom side do you know with with all the responsibilities that comes with it it's tough we always tell people we are adults you know you're going to come here you're going to act like an adult then I think one of the pieces in the culture memo says we don't have a dress code but nobody's come to work naked yet and you know it's like we don't have to have rules and red tape around everything we're going to hide the best people in and allow them to make the right decisions double click on that that buys twice really pumped up for the Olympics but none the less I know I'm every single interview I have virtually say the exact same thing which is the best way I think to describe Netflix culture is with the expense policy No One reviews it and it's five words long which is acting Netflix best interest which means that when we hire you we assume you're going to be an adult you're going to run things as if you were running it for yourself you wouldn't most humans won't run their own life into the ground they're four they're going to run their job hopefully in the same way if given the opportunity to I've never had to sit there and fill out receipts and garlic do that whole member all of you know saying yeah I upgraded the flight for $25 more than I can business class like then they're heading to justify that spend hundreds of dollars if your time saying you've been saved $25 I remember spending the entire day on Earth on expense reports for a week that I traveled Mobile locations it took me a day to do this like that is such a waste of time like you're going to reimburse me anyway just do it so it's nice to know that you're okay me closing remarks from you guys Chrissy hasn't given her they have performance reviews I can feel like you have to rub shoulders with the right people to get your the job you want in fact this is a lot of what Mike and I talked about when I was hiring him it's coming do great work and it will be recognized and so I love that I can look around at our team and see people who have gotten promoted in 6 months of working at Netflix or one of my colleagues got promoted when they were out on Parental leave and you can just really just see that people are having success you don't have to stay here for x amount of years you don't have to get certain amount of marks on your performance review you don't have to jump from one level to the next it really is isn't that the best people will be in the best jobs to have the problem of you're competing with Google Facebook all those guys offer stock options as part of the hiring incentive we don't do that we have a stop auction thing that you can actually buy into we give little bit 5% of the salary on top very standard all this is very standard across the counter at our company is it hard for you guys to try to hire somebody where well yeah but if I work there and you know XY company does really well imma make a lot more money there girls shaking their heads down I haven't come across a very very much and in the reason is in those instances I mean you're you're also handcuffed to stay there for the next amount of time before before receiving any of that money where we are going to Netflix is going to tell you hey we're going to give you this money up front and if you want to go buy a boat if you want to go invest it then then go invest it going back to the whole freedom and responsibility thing we're going to give you everything up front and we're not going to force you to stay for x amount of time before getting a hundred percent of your money we're going to give you a 100% of your money up front and let you know that you do what you like to do with it are the salaries if you look over like a three-year average of someone working at Google doing the same Engineering Process here as doing here is a salary. Comfortable if you look at that that stock options all medical know that turn into July so that's a great question it is because you know well I'll maybe you got hired it a certain salary or compensation were collecting data points from the industry to then always determine your personal top of Market part of Mike & Ikes job is to understand what is this senior software engineer make at the Facebook's are the Googles are excetra when you take into consideration their base bonus and their Equity that's vesting over you know when the annualized amount of time and so we take that into consideration and pay our Engineers to Mike's Point you know in one day pay celery celery looks really big compared to the salaries of the companies cuz there's other compensation they're cracked I'm not just doing that pushed extra bonus not incentivizing you for having more people come to the door for hiring people act like I'm crazy so just massive salaries I'm assuming that the Kaplan trying to hire someone right you helped make the final offer yes it is but that's why we save it for kind of. Final conversation we want people to come here because of the job and because of this company because the people will be working with the product to not because of that dollar amount and because that job's going to fit them it's really important understand that not everybody going to sit here and you've got to be like you said kind of that as I can but Michael was saying earlier that person that gets things done like to have ownership likes to move forward and active exactly it's crucial that in person to me that we don't end in s I think the biggest part of your job is to make sure that we don't get someone that's going to go is always going to ask what to do no offense but also in a can really run for it and then be empowered do that and also change a bit overtime and grout and that's a lot of the time why we we hold back that number until we know someone really wants to work here and I can feel Scary For Engineers of your ask me if I want to work here I don't know what it's going okay and so he take money off the table you we stay we take we pay top of Market if you believe everything that you read about our culture do you want to be here at the end of the day so does that mean they have a verbally accepted before you'll tell them what their offer is in a lot of cases yes from across the country and they don't eat you know they're still trying to understand how their compensation is comparable to the Bay Area and they're moving their whole family likes of course that's a conversation that we're going to have before they sign in ink but in most cases Michael yes we're saying hey the job is yours if you want it we have a lot of data on our end to indicate what type of Market is if you have any data that is helpful please share it with us because this is like a two-way thing and that's what it look like if you work at Netflix's you know you're giving your manager data to that you have about what what your industry is paying want to learn about what I can give you so we know more about it absolutely but but yeah I'll say two candidates the job is yours you know so money off the table do you want this job and of course in the you-know-what you communicate with no two candidates the same so you communicate in different ways but essentially yes I would say 90% of the time were asking candidates to accept before they have an offer Mike that was your experience right I didn't get any any numbers in my offer until the very simply the very last call and I think the reason why I was just because I was still on the fence and I I really appreciate it my recruiter Elena really just digging in in and really trying to figure out do you want to be here I'm like are you are you absolutely sure that you want to be here we're going to pay you well you know you're you're going to make great but we don't want that to be a reason why you come here quite a few friends over there an amusement park of a campus was was nice as well but I I feel like my work yet and Netflix is a lot more fulfilling a lot of that came out during the recruiting process as well to make sure that I was a hundred percent sure that I wasn't running from Facebook that I was you know that I was coming to Netflix instead because if I'm running from Facebook that's that's probably you know that's probably a red flag when it's like all right he's going to come here and then if something you know if something doesn't go well then he's going he's going to jump ship again all of that recruiting time was you know was wasted if if that's the case so I think that's why we think so deeply into it in a really understanding do you want to be here like with everything else off of the table you know do you want to be here and are you going to enjoy the job and you know when things get you know when times get rough are you are you going to jump ship you know are you going to say I'm bored and really try to ride this thing out thank you Chrissy and thank you my course ridge running yesterday and does Michaels in the closing with you had forested I really I really wanted to make a pain but I just I just did not accomplish it no I don't like this is a this is a culture of honesty while so I am being honest here by this is candid moment into my life as a failure which is I was going to make a joke about how you guys are just so talented that we couldn't work it out I felt like I was like Dave Chappelle I write my jokes backwards I start not like Dave Chappelle is why I don't get paid the big bucks I am holding a microphone my page. What that is Mike I feel so bad that I looked in your soul after a couple of drinks okay and I'm like yeah that's awesome how long you going for you like the weekend and I'm like oh my gosh I'm so are you sure you take the timer for 2 days it was just a really last minute flights Wednesday flew out I think the next date Thursday solid like 4 days and Thailand had a jam-packed than by the last they were like he's like we've done so much ready to go but everybody told me that's nowhere near enough time to really enjoy it and maybe you can take it off on Wednesday 25% increase did we go over what you guys would make sense to go over any of you guys not having any idea what's about to happen and then I was just like you have any questions you know they want to know if they all like upset of can cause I was like only tell them that they have to have some sort of culture moment in mind if you're running take more vacation we are at Flix we also kind of in a very monotype tell we are now where can I get a big crowd humor
