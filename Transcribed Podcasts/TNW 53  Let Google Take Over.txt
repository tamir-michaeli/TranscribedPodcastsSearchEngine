TNW 53  Let Google Take Over
everything announced at this week's Google event is fully a worse on Instagram and I got that Bloomberg chip story is it true or not we don't find out today if you love some people you trust this is sweat this is Tech news weekly episode 53 recorded Thursday October 11th 2018 every week we talked to the people breaking the news and about some people were making the tech news I am Megan moroney Jason how is out this week but weirdly there is still Tech news to talk about Google announce new products this week including phones tablets and a brand new home hub joining us to discuss everything that Google has to offer is Cheryl and low reviews editor at Engadget welcome to the show Sharon let's order the pixel 3 you had a Hands-On quick hands on what were your first thoughts this thing feels amazing that's what that was my first thought I've been using a pixel 2 for a long time with a K so I haven't even touched the phone itself for a long time but the new pixel 3 has a glass covering it you know it has rounded edges something that Google say it was like 3D glasses it's not only people that's calling a glass of mix everything just feel very weak fine and smooth almost like an iPhone 8 butt rounder curvier nicer to hold that's the first thing I noticed but the screen also when you look at it it's just beautiful I don't know if we you know what really spend enough time to tell you more deeply about that but that was one thing I noticed it's a huge upgrade for my pixel 2 I think the last time we talked for the launch of the newest Samsung phone the Galaxy Note something-or-other the camera you went all over town and has a great camera so how does I know you only took a few pictures and some of the pictures were a little blurry which you blame yourself for compared to that yes so comparing to the S9 S9 plus I don't know if you know it's not an apples-to-apples comparison I don't think cuz there's dual cameras on Samsung phones including the note 9 which is more recently announced and the pixel camera but it's you know the pixel 2 oxxo having a single camera was one of those favorites of the entire check in the street last year in my testing so far are the biggest difference I'm seeing really is that if you're looking at the pictures on the pixel 2 vs. on the pixels 303 skin just makes your photos look so much better that is easy to be tricked into thinking that the camera is actually that much better you know I feel like you have to put them on the same device and compare the pictures and I don't know that there is that much difference some of the features seem fun but they're not necessarily useful I don't think like photo booths is you know mode that lets you take hands-free pictures because the play when you're smiling but there is a new second lens or camera up front that lets you scan using more friends in your selfies are more of your background I personally like that a lot because it allows for you no selfies that can show you what I'm wearing a j a crop top instead of this is great just yet about the new cameras just because you know we haven't spent that much time and the Selfies that I shared on Twitter No warranty Direct on the pixel 3D but they definitely were blurry and again I hate that I said I liked it so far you know intriguing improvements but doesn't seem to be groundbreaking so I know you I'm currently my daily driver is still the pixel 2 I can't wait so I can get the pixels me as my daily driver United playing with it and yeah I really just can't wait to review season is over and I can make that my primary phone the note 9 is another go to always be 20 pro has been another good one just these were talking just cameras themselves has good Clarity and color is but you know what Samsung software is sometimes introduces artifacts like is noise reduction so aggressive and with the P20 Pro it's artificial intelligence photographer software can also be a little aggressive resident overly enthusiastic in terms of saturating or colors or the pictures are great but not good for like an accurate depiction of what real life looks like let's move on to the pixel slate first of all what is it right I mean if you want to guess when the name the pixels late is a tablet that runs Chrome OS but it also your Google has engineer to keyboard that is meant to go with the sleep to turn it into a more that's out like configuration you'll have to pay an extra $200 for it though but it probably will be worth it if you know you're looking for a multitasking device that you know so if you want both in tablet mode and desktop mode the most intriguing thing about this thing for me is Chrome OS this potential to work in both orientations like as a tablet as a laptop this is a 12.3 inch screen using a LCD display with lower technology that is energy saving which allow Google to squeeze a lot more pixels into this device then you know it's rivals in the space so it is a 3000 by 2000 pixel resolution tired of the iPad Pro the Microsoft Surface Pro 6 and the Galaxy Tab S4 and so that makes for like really good videos or if you want to do some photo editing on your tablet how do they compare in price like to the iPad Pro or the surface so controversial controversial starting price base configuration it is cheaper by hundreds of dollars but you're getting like an Intel Celeron you getting like 4 gigs of RAM it's not the most powerful combination if you're thinking your base starting price you can go out to you and talk y5 even core i7 if you somehow one of Chrome OS device with core i7 16 gigs of RAM for somewhere in the middle like with a core M3 and that will cost you roughly the same as the Surface Pro it's nice to have that cheaper option to start off with I haven't played with a low-power version to see if that a hold up but I know that caramelizing General is a lightweight operating system require all the much resources but again it depends on what you're getting this device where you want to get serious work done you're going to have to like spring for a bit more okay so the only thing that tempted me is an iPhone and a Macbook user was the the home hub and tell him what your thoughts on that this thing is so cute it's small it's really small it's like I held it in my head it felt like I was holding a flower pot or something 2 7 inch I believe screen on speaker base and it's a smart display which means that it will show you things like you know by default see the weather and your upcoming events are there in your calendar it will also show YouTube videos if you watch a recipe of the kitchen if you need anyone it's not doing anything that you wanted to do or if it's just lying around your home we can be a digital photo frames at stores in your Google photos of child or just Brandon Google photos that you like and are you know I apologize why you might shoot yourself I personally didn't hear the sound when we were at the event was really noisy I just so cute and there's four colors that are you know I told Google that my best friend's home is like a grey and pink color schemes I'm going to get her the pink version of the Whole Hog Pit in really nicely as like a hundred and $50 if you have you know the money to spare this is a nice gift for both yourself and I like a very good friend tempted me and then you know I tried to play I Was reminded of the ability on my echo show that I have it on at home they can play pictures but then I have to delete pictures and it just didn't compare because first of all it's only two pictures that I have gone to the effort of uploading to my Amazon Prime account and then it's just all the garbage Google I presume I mean my Google photos account prison it would show only the best photos and only the things that I wanted it to see yeah yeah you can you can select like people that you like so pick those faces that you want to include in I think what they're calling live albums I'm not sure about the name great albums for you based on the faces that you like and the software is smart enough to like take slate leave out pictures that are either blurry or not ready I guess that are repetitive so if you've taken you're like me you take maybe right ton of selfies a day at all I just pick out the ones that are not let you know there's not a lot of change between the best to be in that album that you rotate through on your home screen shots allowed to Google photos right I mean assuming there are no spaces in your screenshots of should be smart enough to do that and it has been very good should be better at that but again haven't play with it so you for real it will work and so what do you think of the choice it's a it's an interesting I think a lot of people are happy that Google didn't include a camera in the device and I think in terms of keeping costs down and the size that it is you know it's good decision I personally prefer to have the option given to me and then have it come with like a physical switch or physical cover so that people can feel safe by like sliding shutter over a camera but you know business decision I get it if you know is $150 is better than a device that doesn't really need it the bedroom and it's like a bedside table TV or you know and then with a camera that can you know called all kinds of anxiety for certain people to have a camera right and such a pretty little thing that you do not buy the Lenovo Google home thing I don't remember did you by chance try that I did take a look at it at Sea as we do also have our review units of that I didn't review it and I again have him play with the Echo Show either have screens to my home very much but the there is so report came out yesterday any from our sex because that Google is using a cast based OS or it's so Hub whereas it's using an Android Things based system for the Lenovo smart display on the JBL you and me and functionally I can't told there's a difference but it might end and that would be the biggest difference year I think otherwise it doesn't go across the board the interface is very similar to it assistant heavy and assistance is similar across all of its visual interface is so I don't know that there will be an actual functional difference between the devices just yet and maybe it was because even though I use Google photos pretty regularly and I use the Google home app like my smart hands either through Amazon or through Apple. I didn't really want to think that were promised really knew that they were going to be coming out with this other device and so sort of you know I don't know created this is to create API repl to create these devices oh I think I work closely together with their later partio yams and I think you're talking about the Lenovo smart display right like loose companies make sure it's not a hundred percent clear yet if it's Android things than it is that like the they have this program they offer it to companies have interest and work with them on making it talks about laying at 8 on the smart displays yeah it's again it's it's not clear also to me whether HBO has to work with Google create something it's again I am not late up to speed on the smart display side of things over the home I just play with the redesign the other day it's so much better than the older version it makes control my smart home devices much easier it's putting all the important switches and controls on the front page where I needed it and just looks much nicer to so like you I have an Amazon Echo that I used to control everything else but the new home app is how many thinking if I need to just let Google take over black Google take out or just just let it let them have everything just have me have all of me here thank you so much for joining us Cheryl and low is the reviews editor at Engadget and she is Cheryl and low on Twitter's a picture of check out all of her reviews of the pixel from her hands on in and just basically her coverage of the entire event thank you so much for joining us thanks so much for having me over the summer I was chatting with a group of 8th graders who were shocked that one of the kids did not have an Instagram account when asked why she didn't have one the girl answered and feeling that's what my mom called it so how much bullying is really going on with teens on Instagram and is it any different than their what the rest of us all experienced as teens to help answer this question I joined by team Tech expert Taylor Lorenz hi hi welcome back to the show Inner Peace you wrote that kids are always building boys have always been but now Instagram provides a unique set of tools to do that bowling can you talk a little bit about what kind of tools make it easy for both ears police I guess it's very easy for a sketch action and go viral on the same way as things to do on Twitter I mean there's no internal and it's just the thing is is if it's sort of like this digital manifestation of teams socialize I mean it really is where most social interaction happens for teens what you know when you're not in school and i r l and so you know it started just because this place where I obviously bowling Dynamics can play out so I guess like the fact that you can set up an account so easily makes it really easy to bully people you can just set up new accounts all the time if he if somebody blocks you I know you have to be to be a real person and it was harder especially in the beginning was harder to creative bank account but it's so easy an Instagram thing in a lot of ways and I think having your you know you're you're one account tied to this one offline identity is a very sore like Antiquated idea of you know how of identity I like how how people died at the you know I should be manifested on my Instagram has put in some protections just not quite as many as it some of this belong to is so subtle it's not anything that Instagram moderator could even you don't necessarily comprehend so sorry well I know a lot of parents who just say no snow Snapchat my kids can't use Snapchat but then they let them use Instagram pretty easily it mean it's a really any difference when it comes to bullying it's now I mean Instagrams worse it's weird that you would let your children use Instagram over Snapchat Instagram was wide open so basically be harassed encounter all these different people restaurants have to close Network it's like inherently more safe but you know parents don't know and I would like so many kids just do it anyway and you know just don't tell their parents about it so I can get better and you know I'm not a parent but I had so I can't I can't I know it's hard but I feel like as a good team but I talk to you the one who said they had spoken to their parents were once it had really kind of open and honest relationships with their parents and their prayers and made it clear like look I've been told you to talk to me about it if things go bad yeah that is easy to say and I guess the other thing about I think maybe the parents that I'm talking to are a lot of them started using Instagram or let their kids use surtees Instagram maybe 3 or 4 years ago before there was all the instant messaging or even answered messaging is so hard to find I know a lot of parents don't even know that that exists that there's messaging on Instagram at all like they just think it's just like pictures yeah and a lot of money I would take most parents I talk to you too or totally unaware how many accounts their kids have like their kids but you know some men page and I have some other account for different types of stuff for like you know so I think Instagram on which a lot of teams do and for a lot of things that's totally harmless but you know there's only so much drama when you're kind of out of it can manifest itself really easy digital late one thing about your peace I found fascinating as some of these kids who are being bullied who have accounts that are that someone has created it specifically to bully them they're actually filing cease-and-desist letter so that's pretty mature for teenager just multiple hate Pages attorneys Instagram and then send it to the girl like you know via screenshot or something and but yeah I guess so yeah it was pretty I mean I think like you just wanted to stop and so at some point you're going to try to do anything and I think it's as adults we often think like the bullying is like you know we're going through our kids Instagram feed and we don't see anyone saying like you're ugly or you're fat or anything like almost there not being bullied but there's all kinds of ways like you said there's the other accounts there are no comments posted on other people's accounts in the comments section and then there's other things that are more nefarious like blocking and unblocking talk a little bit about that yeah I mean well I mean just having someone block you is kind of bling does occur in the comments but I mean so much bullying is also concentrated in other accounts like there's a lot of syrup high school accounts to that are like high school gossip gossip about certain kids I guess we'll see when you're young you're so conscious of like subtle social hierarchies and sort of like reading into every single or interaction like my friend didn't like this photo but she likes this photo or like you know the hiding functionality you can see like maybe a friend posted a picture of you know all 5 of you guys hang out and tag everyone but you like that that could be really hurtful you know but it's subtle it's not like somebody you don't calling you out it's more like excluding or just you know intentionally being being hurtful it in any kind of third-party does to pick up a lot of twin 13 year old boys and one of them was asking like did you see why haven't you liked any of my Instagram pictures did you see them and I was like no I haven't seen them and realize like he had been blocked and I think his twin brother for me so it's like that so some schools are instituting rules around us like you can't take pictures of anyone at school at all I'm stuck little bit about what you heard from kids about that yeah it's actually a piece but I talk to you a high school principal about this I can have extensively to just how hard it is you know for schools they don't have the authority to really police people's online behavior on so they kind of do what they can a lot of high schools have banned you no picture taking just because I'm a lot of schools have you know like the Instagram completely blocked so you can't access you know the game it's really hard I mean I also like that my life was good had you know the address is sembly on bullying and kids were just like making me and memes of the principal play hard and I think I mean but I still think like things like that assembly and these rules are necessary even though kids are going to get around them and they're going to be doing it sometimes when you get there like I give up Instagram but you said kids are even using SoundCloud to buy each other. Just always use everything so I'm yeah I mean there's a whole piece that can be written about all the other platforms kids used to harass each other but yeah this one I'm poor girl had been the exact High School drama that happened but this other girl and guy wrote this tire like diss track against her basically like saying bad stuff about her which is this sort of you know file sharing site for music and all these other kids immediately I updated it and I Instagram bio and she was devastated and there was no take it down you know the kids some soft stop he's not going to take it down so yeah it's not okay we all agree on that hopefully and all these tools like is nothing safe is everything saves like what I mean to some extent adolescence is what they're supposed to do right like we're not like this person and that person so let me know what when you talk to teenagers what are they most want have you talked to them about what they must want from parents or adults or even to I mean I think bowling is really hard so many Instagram chicken harassment seriously I mean eat people on Instagram as they do on Twitter and her husband I think you know what it comes to bullying it is really subtle the kids that I spoke to you all just said that they wish that their parents were more open I think it's so hard because I feel like you're not really ever going to tell your parents everything and it's embarrassing to like a lot of the kids were like I don't want to tell my mom like I feel embarrassed about it, they don't want to acknowledge it or they feel like they're sore like all that person's parents but I've always how you one girl that you know she did her mom and the mom did call the other girl's mom and it did stop and it has been 4 month so I think she was mortified in the moment but ultimately glad that her mom did that so you know kids day like I should just let us do whatever parents to just make it so we can trust them but I think sometimes you have to step in and like Mordecai dark is a little bit so I can tell her thank you so much for joining us again Taylor Lorenz as a staff writer at the Atlantic she is Taylor Lorenz on Twitter I just love I mean what you do right about other things besides teens and Technologies and so I love your work there thank you so much for joining us this week reported that Chinese spies infiltrated almost 30 us companies including Amazon and apple through the technology supply chain but one of the Apple CEO Scipio system says this is an industry-wide problem joining us to talk about the possibility of his kind of hacking is ethical hacker and then each Roy welcome back to the show about how China might infect are Hardware like the Bloomberg story at the supply chain level fact about you have some of the largest companies in the world that are doing their manufacturing over in a country that were known to be cyber adversaries I mean it's it's certainly very plausible and when you think about the amount of time and resources it would take for a nation-state to tell you to train people to hack our systems or even to do the typing itself I mean it seems like a much shorter kill chain to just go right for the manufacturing and insect that ships at you know what the supply chain level that being said I don't know how possible would be I mean I don't know what the security around you know the manufacturing is and you know I mean it's it certainly sounds like a very cool spy asks kind of story but you know again it's just it's hard say how real it would be the NSA and CIA today conduct kind of these kind of operations like are they trying to infiltrate the supply chain around the world are there been publicized stories of both the NSA and the CIA I believe I may be a couple years ago there were a number of NSA tools that were leaked one of which was a I forget the name of it but it was a hardware who's a hard drive firmware it was a piece of mail work for hard drives that lived in the firmware so whenever the hard drive wipe where where to be wiped the firmware would potentially reinstall Itself by putting them out we're back on the hard drive and I mean there is certainly a number of CIA tools that were released as well that were very Hardware specific that were literally embedded in the devices themselves so I mean this is definitely the type of stuff that's being developed at only by our nation but but by other nations as well okay so the NSA says this didn't happen Apple says it didn't happen Amazon so that didn't happen do you think it happen if it did happen and I'm not saying it did but if it did I I can't imagine a company like apple or Amazon suddenly saying yep all of our Hardware's been infected do a recall I mean it's it's just not plausible that being said I I can't imagine that the security around again the supply chain of of the manufacturing process isn't pretty locked down so it would be really hard to say I mean something this sort of a widespread seems a little little bit on the side by side for me so this isn't normally this isn't the kind of packing that you usually look into you usually look last time we spoke to you we just left out there is this I mean how would someone I mean explain a little bit last time you're talking to you is how you do that but how would someone find out whether this was your how would someone be able to find out of this kind of stuff was on the chance to I mean whenever the for the Bloomberg store initially I mean they should have picture at the chip was so tiny that I don't know how anybody would have found it I mean it seems like maybe they were looking for something specific you there yet exactly so I don't know how you even begin to look for hardware at look at hardware for a little chips that size and then begin to sort of reverse engineer it to see what's even on there I mean it just seems very it seems like a long shot to be honest with you or do you think they're just like it's just a big like an urban legend got type of thing I mean and who knows I mean maybe maybe there are parts of the story that are legitimate in the anonymous sources are suddenly saying that you know maybe they found one or two instances for example maybe you know from that the story kind of spiraled out to suddenly being that all these chips were or LDS you know devices for infected with these chips were maybe it was you know sort of like a onesie twosie kind of incident that I'm not saying that's not significant in itself you know unless there's more evidence around what actually happened to hit really hard to say I looked at it but again I mean it it's really hard to say without you know I mean somebody's going to have to look into this right and so I would imagine there be some sort of Investigation outside of just what Bloomberg did I mean I imagine our government would want to start looking into it would have to be some sort of formalized report probably hit Kong Garden upset it at some point there were there just there would have to be something more than just a Bloomberg story about it any updates have you found any if you found my social security number online lately I have been looking for Social Security numbers but there was a pretty big breach that was announced a couple of probably last week a company called Apollo leaked quite a bit of information the same same similar story they just kind of left It Wide Open the really interesting thing with this was that not only did they leak their own information but it turns out that they were scraping information from their customers via Salesforce API and so they were pulling down data that maybe they shouldn't have had and it turns out they were leaking that as well so some of the stuff that they had been grabbing more like the the opportunity data also like the sales at anyone or lost sales for a company they were literally just pulling it down from their customers so you end up having quite a bit of them quite a bit of day today or when you can serve look up the sales history for any NFL pretty large companies so it was pretty significant not perspective security expert and founder of night lion security thanks so much for talk thank you very much take care and finally seems you can get anything on demand today including grandkids TechCrunch reports that a new start-up called papa will connect College to use to senior citizens for companionship and assistance now if you're a senior interested in spoiling someone rotten or just trying to correct the mistakes you
