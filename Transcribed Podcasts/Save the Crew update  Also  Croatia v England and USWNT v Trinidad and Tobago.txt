hello and welcome to the Total Soccer show my name is Darrell grow and his name is Taylor what would you recommend I did doors it's going to be great the reason you're a good patient I made it to the 72nd minute before I just said I think really working hard when I saw you sort of start removedbecause I actually know the news yet we start recording we know what in a few minutes there's going to be some sort of but nothing was specific on this podcast I feel and all day where we know something about 20 minutes to Austin all at once is all the way to Columbus but you won't know because of the magiclet's start in I believe the city of England behind closed doors that was not a single fan in the stadium every week for sure you do I research show me previews the game the swastika on the 5th I believe 2015 the punishment for that is that you to basically have to finance a large city in the best part of the problem at least in the first half is that it felt like consistently players were more focused on keeping their footmoving quickly to meet the balls or like really settling the ball under control because it felt like maybe there was some issues with a surface that is certainly didn't help the play too much I think the rest of tackles as well I think was a lot of losing your feet and kind of sliding to be mean to my contact things to change information which I thought was kind of excited when I saw on the field I realized it was actually sort of a defensive not that much rakitic kovacich play the West me the directions homehonestly to last night with the USA versus Colombia system that they had practice a little bit but nobody was a hundred percent comfortable with England was that I think we can spotting times when are there a rhythm of passing through the middle it tended to be long balls or maybe individual efforts do to the poor field conditions that allowed maybe I can individuals leave it around but they wouldn't really get past Midfield positioned in that and then it would be Marcus rashford decidedin 2 minutes I work at 1 for England and it from the side sure he was trying to like let it roll it was foot so then he could make them go get to make a decision but either way he basically just yeah I'm pretty sure I did enjoy it enjoy this gameLa Crescenta and maybe we should be I think it is that job no matter what's going on to office of an era of inverted Wingers I need the very low bar just talking about what's happening but I don't think it is a sinkAvenues of cross-cutting a second offer Henderson from a free-kick re chain hit the ball and it seems to me that maybe you guys can actions League points on the line that was more or less thing so let's not risk everything that's why I think when I had possession couldn't work it through it was never a real commitment to that's kind of that's why I never really try to in this position to get that away goal it's not like they're Southgate sort of looked at it at halftime maybe before halftime and saw it I could try to change the formation around I could change the person a little bit but there's always that chance that one and now we got to chase versus right now no draw a way from home giving you a fresh did against pankration out very much in third place right nowcan you go for the win against Croatia at home if you look at 4:33 because it's always going to be the ones who stayed a bit more home supposed to link up with the front three players instead of on the ball a lot with nobody really around him when he's passing through the midfield for Englandone or two or three players did the attackers tended to say why was all right installing a combination plays on getting forward it seem like they were staying home a little bit more than that for salons with Windows process are coming in for the right hand side I believe that was the only sub of the game what did you make him Guidance Centeris there anything like that but it was still he came in we thought maybe he would come in for Marcus rashford instead he came on for a little bit of a centenario things fingers to it otherwise I could have been more problematic cross so it seemed like he brought a little bit more of a spark a little bit more enthusiasm to what was otherwise a more so static attack by Chanel England nail no one was at the Satanist we were here to watch it do you think the US women used up all of the goals andTrinidad and Tobago 7 and it was pretty the goals and in the first two games against Mexico and you had a few set these goals, it was just much more people open inside the six-yard Box people Miss hits. But I don't think she was trying to have itit makes me think that like Trinidad, maybe like I can't feel like there's a chance that maybe they just weren't ready for players of the US is quality to be able to hit the shot that hit from 2025 yards out and it was sort of everybody we're going to cause problems will win everything that we can in the air maybe we'll be able to shut them out and instead and then from there you get lots of more than Trinidad could handle done how to stream music from distance as wellthe way that it makes the same noise every time the ball hits the next Wednesday evening the semifinals in the US has to win to qualify for the worker gets Jamaica do I think we'll be at First Choice lineup against Trinidad on Wednesday with the important this was my concern this was I was curious aboutJamaica different position than we face then maybe you go back to the things that are on the second half which game will win the championship I think she would like to sell it all right to do this week in Reston player here we don't need to take this seriouslysemi-final game looking towards the final because you can always run into problems I'm not sure I think that would be plenty but you still want to have your strongest the reason because you want to be continued to get that chemistry and that familiarity with each other in the lead for the World Cup York City us hopefully time progressed to the concacaf Women's Championship game probably be going to be Canada Mexico Panama goes through to the next round your three of the four semi-finalists qualified person look upWednesday night that wasn't you might think it was but it wasn't Today Show sponsored by the US Women's National team, is a great place to find specific goes in a variety of textures I believe as well so maybefuture you can get an English, I'm not sure right now yeah Michigan 20% off if you use that you get 20% off any scarf you see if you find you really enjoy that hungry grease game and you really want to support one of those definitive it's not what we think it's hashtag save the cruise shipwe are in the process of saving more so than we have been recently, nothing else thinks can break. But what we've learned a lot of reading Bradbury stories score of the Columbus partnership which is Columbus area who is one of the owners of which NFL teamCleveland Browns and dr. Pete Edwards who is a Columbus area group of local businesses they said there in 5 p.m. Eastern today they said well there are many details to be our alliance is working diligently and collaboratively with to keep the crew in its can we are very excited about the quiet but deliberate progress that has been made to date update as this process moves to keep this until the deal was done to finalize things started to leak at some point that still has not happened at 9:40 but we still want to talk about it because it seems like things are Advanced enough in negotiations I'm going to like withholdJasmine tell something's officially announced until the ink has dried if it's the least maybe haven't found a local Columbus businesses are fronted by Doctor P the weird Russian Nations have a contract that says we can move the team to Austin we are still committed to an Austin team with the weird tree thing in major league soccer with operations in 2021the new Investment Group is going to buy into Major League Soccer and then they're going to have his team and then this team will magically appear on paperwork in the actually I think they see what it's going to be is this new ownership group will have to pay I'm going to assume an exorbitant the Columbus Crew but then free Court will retain ownership rights to a franchise at some pointcrew trophies in history I mean for sure I mean it's still the case even with this Major League Soccer was working towards keeping the crew there unless it comes Santa Claus in there was like I can't move the team Austin and I to meet at that feels like there's a little bit ofI would applaud them for actually have essentially tried to patch it up with this way deals that's going to happen seems like some sort of fix it's going to happen I mean yeah I honestly I don't I don't agree with you because I don't think that it's like MLS went out and try to find new owners to make this happen it seems like I wanted to try to keep my benefit from it but it sort of all of the results I think our other people working behind the scenes to make something happensee one do one single thing is it's credit to everybody it's credit to the pressure that's been put on my G-Shock to come up with this fulfill the obligation that we decide to be removed so just send me that but I think the bigger thing was just that you had so many people publicly against this move in other leagues in other organizations you have teams move ontime and I think it becomes so normal 31 teams from the NFL come out in support of the one team that doesn't want to move that's how it goes and that's why you have that so often that's true but what I'm saying is basically what I'm going to snow this was the writing's on the wall that this is going to be the most hated let this happen and I also there wasn't nearly the reaction from Austin that I think they thought they would get because of the just because I think if I think a lot of people in Austin would be fine with a soccer team but when you know everything else that goes to the campaign to raise when suddenlywhat's that exactly I think so so I just keep watching the movie with the given so Wiggly set up at it so complicated money that's part of the reason why this announcement hasn't happened yet rumors and hence is because I think there's going to be a lot of like yeah yeah yeahgames if I own them projection lights have the contracts up there and I'm just more so I do enjoy that it's already started that I've already seen Browns fans tweeting like we could have kept their attention was on the football team that is known as itscross the border similar to what happened with the Baltimore Colts moving Indianapolis more Ravens that happen overnight people really a new franchise as the Cleveland Browns in like 97 I think it was but I bet that what it was like to have a franchise kind of stole it away from the fans in the middle of the night or over the course of the year as it is the case of Columbus and maybe that factors into this decision a little bitthere's no legs and there's no that's for darn to it concerned about recent unzip trusting said that to me this reverses eventually we think but has its I mean it's been a terrible year for Major League Soccer there's lots of lettuce boil over into people honestly people like Daryl Grove almost there MLS to succeed will watch Major League Soccer die hard but also will read the headline that doesn't necessarily care about his fan base I think you're right but that probably factors into the decision to paraphrase Winston you can trust MLS to do the right thing I wish I haven't stumbled into a sentence future US soccer league victory news I'm following on Twitter Darby they will fight on Newport beaches I think is what he said just got to Network please, I'm looking to sign Marshall scouting Conrad delafuente the 17 year old American attacker for Barcelona it has been a big match against PSV Eindhoven not
