USA v Colombia quick take  hot take review
lady asked me if that was an actual introduction that's indicative of Welcome to the Columbia will have a full review of USA to Colombia. We don't have a Frozen right now the future is fromkind of hat like all of the future is marketing the Next Generation series or whatever this being billed as to keep a game and it felt like some of those problems are still there and that's kind of where I'm coming from at least this I'm frustrated with their for this results interested why are you for sure coming on TVhow to Target and could be had my frustration is obviously I didn't see it as an issue addressed it or the players just didn't do what he wanted either way it's an issue and I think that's yes he got some results early on but the more we talk the more we seen that he doesn't have the ability to adjust on the Fly he doesn't make some of the changes that we would like to see made and it feels like again he's an interim manager and said for us to buy Columbia you guys know that this iswaiting for full-time coach and in the meantime we got a bunch of games scheduled I think part of it is that I really talked myself into this game like I don't talk myself into as I had started to feel what are we doing until we have a coach until we know we're doing and have a game plan for how we're going to proceed what's the point of this but I really we did the show I kind of got excited and it felt like okay we're seeing some things there's that come back that's really exciting but I had I feel like I got myself like okay it could be said he could be a good gameI was starting to feel like what's the point of this until we have a manager but I talk to myself until it's okay baby it's going to be good I believe in the team and then here we are okay I don't disagree with the US in the shape in the first half four to four and we had Michiganthe u.s. bank for the space in between a moment when I back line was made 5 yards from our own 18 and then we still had our for maybe 10 which are 424 I supposed to clean those lines under pressure it felt like almost this like haha we got four people across the front seat in front of them to begin with will test that theory when we there was lots ofI saw. I don't really have much to say and we saw him giving a very emphatic team talk everybody surrounding him definitely the gestures indicating with the fact that that happened coming out of halftime wanted to a visible sign that he was still the leader maybe that's the case I still have no idea what we're doing or how to do with this we got to figure something out free second half definitely let's talkthis could be the Bradley Redemption game cuz you have to pass out to Robinson to be danger space between yeah yeah I'm excited to see that I'm excited to see if there were more bright spots because right nowbut that spaghetti into it before kickoff at the fact that leaving this game I'm sort of like what is that the back line that I want to see it sort of feels like even the stuff that I thought we had answers to or we at least had a foundation for how we move forward I now look at that Foundation again wondering like is that going to work or do we need to change the person I like that or maybe it is just that the system didn't work all of that leads to more questions is Isaac we need to accept that the current status of is such that when we go up against someone like Columbia Julian green3 centimeters to try and try and hold up. We talked about this a little bit off are but if you're playing a sportis that a Hannah is Hammer when your friend West you you can you can and if you don't do that you're going to run into trouble and its states does game start of thinking probably better but we might be able to compete so let's just try some stuff as a result it constantly look to me like everybody was just trying to put out fires and then we didn't really change I still like so many of the problems we saw were so consistently problems that it didn't feel to me like there was ever that next level of okay this tire goes inside you're going to stay but if the situation reverse is like there wasn't that next level of the briefing so it's not like I think so yeah I felt like they were set up in the system that they didn't quite understand and then once they didn't know how to deal with the issues because they've been told no you don't go out wide but if there's a problem that why you've been exposed to be told don't go there while you do the exact site will be back in tomorrow morning tonight or tomorrow
