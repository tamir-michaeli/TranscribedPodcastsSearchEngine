Blockchain beyond Bitcoin  The Energy Sector
welcome to Scientific American Science talk posted on February 28th 2018 I'm Steve mirsky you can't swing a bag full of quarters these days without hearing something about blockchain usually related to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin but blockchain technology is also being adopted in the energy business so what the heck is blockchain let me read from a January 2018 Scientific American article by Alexander Lipton and Alex pentland called Beyond Bitcoin most everyone has heard of Bitcoin but that's only one piece of an up-and-coming Financial technology industry characterized by Buzz and speculation what is important to know is that the core invention is a quote distributed Ledger and quote database Sheridan managed by multiple participants think of it as a communal digital bookkeeping system it represents the foundationtechnology that is made cryptocurrencies simply digitally encrypted currencies such as Bitcoin possible its underlying data structure called a blockchain is held in a series of sequential encrypted blocks to make those blocks reliable and secure they are consensually updated by a variety of proving mechanisms that involve both humans and computers so it's a database of encrypted information that can be updated by multiple users now back to blockchain Beyond Bitcoin in November freelance science journalist Kevin Bigos attended the US power and renewable Summit in Austin Texas organized by GreenTech media Bigos filed this report it runs just under 9 minutesalmost everyone at the conference agreed that huge changes are coming to the energy industry partly because of innovative software and Technology that's disrupting traditional markets and helping consumers and businesses who support green energy some people see a revolution on the horizon similar to the way cell phone for Place landlines one possible new force is blockchain here is John Crites a managing director at the Rocky Mountain Institute Colorado nonprofit founded in 1982 by environmental scientist mr11 over the last year Rocky Mountain Institute has been working with a number of different Global energy players to create What's called the energy web foundation and that is a foundation dedicated to helping develop blockchain and specifically a public open source blockchain for using the electricity sector there a number of different energy players so shall unstatic oil along with different electricity companies like energy in Germanyoryx on G and France centrica in the UK potentially helping the growth of renewable energy supply chain is a fascinating technology here that has a couple of key characteristics one it is inherently secure secondly it can help use financial and physical markets in a way that's extremely low cost to lower the cost of transaction thirdly it has the ability to enable Smart contracts to make any transactions around Renewables or distributed demand response seamless and fully automated right in those all make it very powerful for incorporating in yes distributed forms of Renewables because it's a very low-cost way to integrate them into a market platform but also to integrate in lots of different forms oflatent Energy Efficiency or demand response that exist around any building whether it be a residence or a commercial establishment we're talkin hear about HP AC systems and Refrigeration were talking about LED lighting you know and other forms of energy consumption that can be digitized and easily integrated into Market platform that just sends a price signal and then threw a blockchain mechanism allows you to balance out the use of energy among those different resources to an optimal and low level so that the minimum amount of energy is required and so that the maximum amount of Renewables and or batteries are used in the process so even though it's not directly Target in climate change and took out the effects of a more efficient or less carbon intensive grid do you think our senses that it would make a much more efficient market and a much more efficient Grid in termsits overall operation allowing us to draw in more distributed resources more effectively which would minimize the amount that we would need Central generation and allow us to better accommodate some of the fluctuations that we see in Renewables and it sounds like you both for the large companies are always already working with but down the road and three to five years you could be the kind of apps that could be built into a household inverter or some other system that's exactly right so we can we see this as a technology that could serve as the backbone for the entire electricity system here from Big utilities and thinking about the power trading in the dispatch mechanisms that they have on their plants all the way down to again the personal power plants that exist at an individual's houses when they have a solar array on the roof or when they plug in electric vehicle into their garage they can transact in a way with the grid as being anindependent wholesale Market participant we're starting to see regulatory reforms globally that would allow that this is a technology that enables it how fast will The Regulators work in setting the playing field, where this there do you think The Regulators are going to have ultimate control over this or not it's an interesting challenge right because this is a very complex and technological area that most Regulators are really thinking about a lot today and it's coming very fast the speed of innovation here is at the speed of software not the speed of the electricity utility industry I do see ways for this Market to assemble from the bottom up and be a bit disruptive in that there are ways to actually create a blockchain enabled local systems but I would expect you know in in the not-too-distant future that you know over the next year or two people would be able to either buy or ingreat in software that allows them to essentially use this secure mode of energy management on their homes are in their businesses and straightforward and to be quite a lot of this would be autonomous people wouldn't have to make the choices it would be built into the that's exactly right the virtual here as you can set up a few rules on the system and then the system will run itself against those rules some experts aren't so sure about blockchains potential here's Brian Janice Microsoft director of energy strategy blockchain for energy Peak blockchain for everything but then we're going to put blocking for parenting I'm going to have the blockchain raise my children but I think it does have it is a transformative technology in certain spaces I think from everything I've seen so far it's a you can offer some marginal Improvement in the spaceI got to see how it is going to be ultimately transformative because it's a very unique it's very it's still going to be tied to the grid and wavy regulated and how we design Market your blockchain is already showing promise so is Larry temlock co-founder of the sun exchange the company is developing new ways to finance solar projects in developing countries created a Marketplace whereby people can buy solar panels and have them least remotely where there's a lot of sunshine and we're developing communities really need the energy desperately so we're a matching up buyers and sellers or matching up providers of capital and people who need Capital to build solar systems in Emerging Market in Africa right now we built for project so far will be expanding into two by next month and we are actively searching for other places to do businesssounds like blockchain really has helped you lower costs and make these Project Reality yeah that's right and we use blockchain on several different layers the simplest thing is that we accept payment in Bitcoin and ether and other currencies for the solar cells that we sell at the market they cost about $7 each so there's a very low entry price when you buy a $7 solar cell and you earn a rental monthly on that solar cell you were talking about very small rental payments that need to go back to people so by paying that rent allowed in digital currency lowering transaction cost and avoiding the Commercial Banking, correspondent banking system we really make these micro payments and micro investing in solar capacity possible on another level we have a smart contract that helps us to cost-effectively service the Project's the projects have iot Smart Meters on them that constantly monitor the electrical output of the systemand also monitor the bank balances the prepaid Bank balances of the consumers and so by putting these two things together we can have the smart contract calculate and automatically withdrawn from the account the required amount of money on a daily basis if necessary reserve some money for maintenance and insurance and then pay out to all the 1600 investors in the project their daily balance energy rental you know using fiat currency in Traditional Bank account but with watching and digital currency this is you know this is very possible so there you have it. But we'll have to see how it plays out with customers regulators and marketsthat's it for this episode get your science news at our website www.scientificamerican.com where you can check out our ebooks just go to the store section on the menu the latest of the dozens of e-books available is the science of diet and exercise which might come in handy if you're still working off the Christmas goose and follow us on Twitter where they get a tweet whenever a new Adam hits the web site are Twitter name is at Siam for Scientific American Science talk I'm Steve mirsky thanks for clicking on us
