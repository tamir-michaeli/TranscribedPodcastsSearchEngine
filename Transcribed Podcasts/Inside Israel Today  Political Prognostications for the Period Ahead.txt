Inside Israel Today  Political Prognostications for the Period Ahead
you're listening to inside Israel today with Gail Hoffman on the land of Israel Network hello and welcome to inside Israel today on the land of Israel Network on the land of Israel. Com on the final Tuesday of the summer vacation summer vacation made your kids have been in school for 2 months well my kids have been in school now for half of that time with all the ways to but you and I have different jobs and knesset members do nothing members have been on vacation for 3 months the holidays have ended up absolutely no idea why they are not back in the parliament passing laws right now I was back at the knesset yesterday I was there on a Monday at 4 which is usually the busiest time of the week with the knesset is in session I admit I was there in order to use the gym but I looked at the the electronic board near the cafeteria that shows how many knesset members were hard at work in the building and the answer ladies and gentleman was 66 Crescent members who if I'm remembering correctly I'll happen to live in Jerusalem and it's not too inconvenient for them to get to the building maybe I even nice for them to get away from their kids we're back from school if they were the only ones who are there in the building now I'm hoping that next week will be different because because it does come back to session next Monday but then again Tuesdays we'll see they tend to work harder on Mondays and Wednesdays and they do on Tuesdays but I'm hoping it even on a Monday and then that the knesset members will be there because right now what they're saying is that they shouldn't really be passing anything that costs money not anything controversial because our elections are coming up that's right ladies and gentlemen 2019 will be an election year in Israel whether we like it or not now there are positives and negatives about the different system that we have for electing our government over here and Israel the obvious positive is that a given point you could bring it down I know that a lot of the listeners to this show live in the United States and it's fair to say that probably a hundred percent of you either don't like your current president or your previous president is is that fair my producers nodding his head if you know what are the other with the way America is polarized right now I'm sure a lot of you don't like either of them but there's probably none of you who like both so if we have a prime minister here we have a leader we don't like we can get rid of him relatively easy we don't have to kill him we can just vote him out we can initiate an election at any given point you are stuck with your president for 4 years and if you don't succeed in voting him out you're stuck with him for 8 now then again your president can't last more than 8 no matter what you do and it's in yellow has been bar prime minister since 2009 where entering 2019 he was prime minister before that from 1996 to 1999 he can actually stay prime minister forever death death is no match for Netanyahu Netanyahu can last longer than death and he could very well be prime minister in another 80 years then again then again we do have criminal investigations none of the other hundred nineteen members of knesset can bring him down but there is an attorney general who can bring him down and he's going to make 2019 interesting his name of the Beehive mandelblit and there's a reason why when the Jerusalem Post name the 50 most powerful Jews in the world knitting I was number two and if it was number one there are three different criminal investigations that all could bring down the Prime Minister and the Attorney General is wisely taking his time making sure that whatever decision he makes he will have enough information enough data enough support to back him up the most embarrassing thing in the world would be if you force out very popular prime minister and then trial the prime minister is done proven innocent so he's only going to indict the Prime Minister when he has all the proof that he needs in order to do it now because it is taking time it's getting into our election year it's apparently Almost sure now that we will have an election before we will have a verdict on an indictment on whether the Prime Minister will be charged with bribery or some other lesser charge that means that Nathaniel will have a great advantage in this election because in the eyes of the voters right now he is innocent until at least indicted if not proven guilty in a court of law which could take years and so he according to the polls will win this election by a landslide and if anything with all due respect to how exciting this election is going to be the real excitement is going to happen after the election after all the mudslinging takes place between the different parties and then they come back and they swear it a new knesset shortly after that apparently is when the Attorney General is going to rule and it's still looking almost certain that the Attorney General will decide to indict the Prime Minister for bribery and at least one of the three cases that's a very serious charge that's a charge that has a jail time pretty much automatic so then what happens well there are different scenarios I was aware of only two of them until yesterday but yesterday there were two very interesting reports that I'd like to tell my listeners up at okay I thought the most obvious thing to happen would be did y'all get reelected and then he governs it's not easy to govern when you're on trial but for the first 6 months anyway after the indictment are there would be a preparation for a hearing the heat of the indictment is pending the hearing was a real and then there are processes that lead up to the trial So eventually though he would have to be running the country while I'm trying to let means spending all day in court and then committing a security cabinet night that that's not pleasant but it can be done so that's narrow number one ladies and gentleman according to the law that there was an in France that they going back to the days of meter on law is you cannot in sitting prime minister or president that is something it's allowed to allow that exists to allow the government to run smoothly without having little annoying things like investigations and indictments get in the way of getting things done and so the Prime Minister and I have met you I was the only one who could form governments can tell the various Coalition Partners one of the conditions for joining the government is immediately passing this French law and then really allowed to remain prime minister as I said forever another ride 80 years are both his father and his father-in-law and my father-in-law lived until they were a hundred so that is a strong possibility though it's hard because it's not easy to pass a law that is retroactive leaving the normal you're supposed to pass a law that that the only really start taking effect of the next government it's hard to pass a lot of personal that's really just intended to help him it's hard to pass a law that is corrupt but could they do it yes it can be done yesterday journalist in Israel the channel to political correspondent I hope is Bobby in Los Angeles is listening when I say that he's a top journalist in Israel so she can be proud reported that the reason unknown law in Israel he listed the number of it so it sounded real that the members of knesset have immunity and one of the reasons why they have immunity from prosecution is in a case where they feel that they are being discriminated against and as a meat pointed out that is one of the central argument of netanyahu's cases that friends in the newspaper collusion Affair when it's me I was accused of offering up a bribe to receive a bribe from the publisher of video talking about the second largest circulation newspaper that is a newspaper would become last anti him he would it work to make sure that another newspaper the toxic relationship a provisional would come out less often which could give that second largest circulation newspaper a million dollars of a year worth of adds extra in that case let's meow has been arguing well it's not just me there have been other politicians and Israel who acted on behalf of one newspaper against another the previous election one of the reasons it happened was that your key members of knesset we tried to shut down paper and Israel by passing a law that you can't have a newspaper owned by a foreigner so artist paper giving out for free so missing out argues all those people also should be prosecuted why am I being singled out why is there this discrimination against me in the expensive gift Affair when it's me I was accused of receiving cigars for himself and Industrial amount of cigars from Rich Hollywood producer and also pink champagne and jewelry for his wife Sarah and his lawyers have been arguing wait a second the previous prime minister Edward all-mart he was acquitted of receiving very expensive hens from a rich person if he was acquitted in that case why is Nathaniel being singled out and it's hard for him to be accusing of a big discriminate against using a word overt as an example because I did go to prison for other cases but yes they had an affair was not one of them answer this immunity idea could also work then there was an idea that was raised Anna a report that I heard in the morning on the radio by the political analyst of Israel radio his name is Hinata Crystal and Hanan said wait a second who says and then today I was going to be the next prime minister of Israel and it should have listeners are hearing this and say what who else is there who can we vote for besides and the answer was no he's not saying he won't get the most votes he sang that there's another man who could bring down to to the owl who will make his decision before the Attorney General ad he I'm like the attorney general who had a good working relationship and it's in the eye of the past used to being employed employed by letting you buy just cabinet secretary this is a man who is Hayden Antonio for decades his name is reuven rivlin he's a president and by the law in Israel the president can appoint any members of knesset to form a government it doesn't have to be the leader of a party it doesn't have to be the leader of the largest political block if usually is a leader of the largest party not always not forget the 2009 election when it's in your how was appointed by President Shimon Peres to form a government Tippy livni the leader of Kadima the party up at Shimon Peres had last been in one one more seat and it's me I was the quick but it's definitely would have an easier time of forming a government cuz he was the leader of the largest political block at the time but no according to the law and Israel the president can pick any member of knesset to form a government be present could right now so I'm going to take me out and say I don't want you to be prime minister anymore I want or in a closet to be prime minister a goofball liquid MK who was 30th on the list of the liquid at 1:30 seats and then if a majority if foreign husband could form a government with a majority of the members of knesset he could be the Prime Minister quite soon and so the president can say this man is about to be indicted for bribery sorry but I decide I'm not letting him form of government or the largest Party by far pick somebody else there's precedent for that let's not forget that when a old Barack form the government he is people said anyone but shots they wanted anyone but shots are dealt Orthodox part of the government and Barack for the government with sauce but said are you there isn't going to be a minister cuz he had been already indicted so this could happen as well that the president could end netanyahu's political career so what is this all going to be happening this is all going to be happening after election no one advantage that you have in America is that you know when your elections going to be you know that your election is on the first Tuesday in November 6th except if it's November 1st or something like that and Israel are laws say that elections are held on the third Tuesday in the month of cheshvan except if the previous year was a leap year in which case will be held on the first Tuesday of the month of cheshvan the month of cheshvan begins at 6:13 is real time tonight so according to the law and Israel are elections are really sad for a year from the month that begins tonight but we haven't had an election on time since 1988 which is one of the first time then it's me I was elected to the knesset even that election in 1988 doesn't really count as last nipple for years because you had to prime minister's how you talk to mirror and Shimon Peres who rotated in the prime ministership during this for years so elections in Israel 10 to get moved up and it's now almost certain that this coming election 2019 again not moved up by much but moved up none the less ministers are fighting too much you're not going to be able to accomplish anything when it comes back on October 15th next Monday so what are they going to do they're going to first of all try to clean up various legislation that needs to be passed that it's all it's almost past they can do and they're going to stall because we have elections coming up on October 30th for Mayors and you don't want to mix those mirror all races with the knesset of racists their run very differently the political parties are very different so we can't really have an election until after October 30th on November 13th is the runoff races for those Municipal elections and we're definitely have a runoff race apparently in in Jerusalem which is racing at the cares a lot about I don't see the election being initiated before then we also have very important appointments that are going to be made in the very near future for a new Chief of Staff of the Israeli Army chief of police a new Bank of Israel Governor so those things have to be done before an election is initiated to so I expect the election to be initiated shortly after the 13th of November they have to be initiated by the 2nd of December which is the deadline to pass a new law to draft a student's this law is very difficult to pass is going to be a meeting of the Council of rabbis of one of the ultra-orthodox parties this coming Sunday and unless they decide to surrender which Ultra Orthodox rabbis tend to not do very often they're not going to be able to pass a new law and so will know that the election basically has to be initiated during that two-and-a-half week. And elections are by law held anywhere between 90 and 150 days after they are initiated on a Tuesday That's the Law now the tradition tradition is to do it the minimum number of days later the first Tuesday from 90 days on work and so if our election is initiated on the last Thursday in November or the previous week before that in our election will be held on February the 26th which is the most likely dates right now as we're sitting here but there is a nother Factor which is those criminal investigation because of those criminal investigations Netanyahu could receive advice from his lawyers to try to get them held a little bit later to try to stretch out as much as you can maybe to try to pass the ultra-orthodox conscription law anyway it's not looking likely right now but let's just say his lawyers are going to have an impact on whether next election is going to be held in it to know right now it's looking like he wants to have the election before the indictment so if anything he would want to have them as soon as possible which would mean initiating immediately after that November 13th election that's a Tuesday so if you have them initiated by November 15th then we could actually have the elections on February 12th that's a possibility anyway it should be very exciting and Netanyahu as we're sitting here definitely has the edge no one could really bring them down even the former Chief of Staff of the idea from hasn't entered politics been against who has the best chance of getting elected doesn't have a very good chance of getting elected especially the Helm of a new party and no one's heard of yet which is the way it's looking right now that that he would try to run and that leads us to the leader of the party that maybe he should be heading which is the Zionist zionists Union with the main alternative to Nets and I was the queen of the last black shirt in 124 seats compared to netanyahu's leak what's 34 most of the election campaign of is leading in the polls and is that party was smart he would tell its current leader of the guy by we don't like you anymore you have no chance of getting elected we're getting rid of you right now the laws in the party make it almost impossible to do that but when there's a will there's a way and there should have a well , but I don't see it happening right now they're getting 12 seats in the polls 10 in the more like this naira that they've been against is running seats so why is this man still being left there cuz he got elected and why this man being taken seriously by the world I don't know yesterday he met with the King of Jordan the King of Jordan is a busy guy the King of Jordan has a lot of problems to deal with the King of Jordan has to deal with a lot of Syrian refugees with the Islamic State still sort of existing with all kinds of threats to him the Round Rock and the mess in Syria all very serious problems and he meets with Abigail by I'd like to think you received some bad advice that that was worth his time which guy thing leads us back to America which we talked about at the beginning at least you know that your politicians come and go when it comes to the White House we because we don't have term limits we don't have the new blood coming in and the people of Israel don't seem to want so that's what we will have except if one of the scenarios we talked about happens never a dull moment in Israeli politics stay tuned because after the break we will be talking about those local Municipal racist and we're having here and why they are exciting hi this is Eve Harrell host of Rejuvenation on the land of Israel Network you came here and you show for me every Sunday and every day of the week shows from another one of my very talented fellow show host reach me Eve at the land of Israel.
