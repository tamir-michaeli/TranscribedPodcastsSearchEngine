WhatIsTrackingYourNetWorthWorth
everybody Welcome to listen Money Matters money is Like Oxygen you don't care about it until you're deprived of it my name is Matt I'm here as always with Andrew Andrew Andrew and how are you and what are you drinking I'm very relaxed and cucumbers over your eyes and it's it's really throwing me off a I I lied to you I said I was going to drink an IPA and I justmy my IPA IPA is like pumpkin spice lattes for white men that live in Colorado yeah yeah but what tickles me are Stouts especially Imperial Stouts I don't care the season that just like my jam as well but and and coincidentally or not coincidentally Eric from Supply also sent me an imperial stout that is above 10% so I can meet you thereI'm doing that what's it called Ibex Cellar Supply Barrel aged Imperial Stout no damn that's a nice bottle nice tastes as as I would want it to taste listen not not to make plans over a podcast episode but I really think that you know we didn't episode about travel hacking with credit cards and I think you should get a flight here because the Stout seen and the IPA seen here is redonk and we could just go all over the place and get you all of the Stouts and German or or pastry like my help my house is full of them in fact I usually don't end up drinking them because we I saw them for so long I just sit on you know a little bit but I got one here it's in a can and it's it's made by a company called Armadillo Ale Works Armadillo Ale Works in Texas and you can see the can if you look at it in the basic it says not for retail so buddy of mine did some volunteer work for the American Brewers Association it which is here in Colorado and they had it they had a 2018 World beer cup and he was sorting boxes of sample beers at all of these places were sending their beers in the Colorado to get judge for some World beer cup thing and they gave him just like 3 or 4 cases to take home for volunteering yeah I've all different shit now volunteer 400 totally he was doing physical labor and help the children how's the temperature in yet but here's the deal I had I had a Kazakhstan e beer like super gross but I had one today why was I like cuz it was it was like if Budweiser took a shit into another Squad wiser it was it was it was like a beer from Sri Lanka Just Dance has a condo no just like yeah places that use would expect beer come from they have beer at cuz it's called the Imperial golden Stout 10%. No I said I was going to cast out if you drink an IPA that's right now we're twins ease except mines of gold Stout which means it's gold and I'm just curious what what does imperial mean in the name Imperial just means more alcohol also fun fact if you drink a double IPA it just means more alcohol triple IPA just means more okay so yeah this is a golden Stout and the name of the beer which I think is important and timely and interesting call brunch money bit I guess this is what it looks like this is what I cast out to you know it really doesn't I would always hit it be now just looking at the color they use like coffee and chocolate so still gives it the Stout flavor of like dark roasted stuff but it's not using dark malts just more facts anyway I want to thank via Twitter at underscore I'm assuming Amy Desai I'll spell that it's at underscore Amy Desai for our catchphrase this episode Money Money Is Like Oxygen don't care about it until you're deprived of it couldn't agree more money matters.com community and Facebook group and you should send in their catchphrases they're so now that that's out of the way let's talk about net worth what do you know what net worth of this tell me I do it is a is a number the dollar figure in America of your assets minus your liabilities and that is your basically if you die you are worth x amount of dollars that'll go to somebody you probably got I don't know but yeah it's it's a number that you as a person are worth because of your of ownership in things the amount of money you have in cash available cash tonight I might even have an investment stay under your name - the things that you have in debts like credit card debt mortgage mortgages car loans anything else if you would like that was like that was $100,000 they like Zillow is like $100,000 and you have $80,000 in the mortgage your net worth in that scenario be 20,000 yeah so I have a so actually to tell you exactly what I have which is really sad I have a mortgage I have a property in South Jersey it's a little condo that I bought in 2008 Monday October 3rd 2008 on the fucking day bro on the day I was over Just Like Heaven an hour I've told the story about your time and it's just a fun act out of a mortgage that is right now I have $130,451.47 left on the mortgage and my house the actual condo according to a zestimate from Zillow is worth 149 so take those two numbers subtract it I have like $15,000 roughly in that's good I mean something estimate though I mean how come on tell me how reliable are zestimates so I hear the story so you know for the first long as I've known you we've been we've been pushing mint.com because meant was is free way to track all your expenses your bill pay your awesome I literally have a week off of work to write in a book called mastering men submits great I mean for that reason it's still like it is free which is right they got bought out by into it which is which on QuickBooks and TurboTax Quicken so I logged into meant to get back on the podcast I'm like you know a person but it's just always kind of work do you know just always kind of work in the background and never had to pay attention to it I never use a budgeting tool and I'm the Taurus Lee known for like not about not about you to explain some of the situation so I log in a minute and first of all it's a pain in the ass to get into cuz I haven't been in it so long but I noticed like all my accounts were doubled up and so much like backlog like figure this all out who's been on my ass so I had someone told me about me I knew about personal Capital but someone's personal capital I was like okay well let me try that I mean it's free also so I set up a personal capital account you no added in all of my personal stuff so I did I excluded all of my like business shit so personal Capital only shows my cash on hand which is my simple bank account for my investment accounts which are betterment of a betterment Roth and a better meant you no brokerage my three active credit cards that I use for personal stuff my car loan what is the lease and my mortgage and that's it that's all I'm looking at in personal capital and so to me I felt personal Capital it really highlights your net worth right so to be clear like I want to get into the store again mint is super SKU towards budgeting like it is for someone who needs or wants to budget and I kind of think that they should be one in the same like you you should budget but I do still and I will hopefully always will mint is awesome at that personal Capital does a light touch of that but it is far more a net worth and wealth-building Tool women's German bat not at all remotely right so I still have my mint account I really like it because it shows my credit score and it keeps it updated the right now my credit score is 826 which is awesome dude that's ridiculous that's every time if it goes up by one point I screenshot my mom a picture of it I want a cool put on their fridge she knows she knows that like I've had bad I mean like that I did all this work to like build up all my credit the only thing that is like sort of a ding against me is that I have my average age of credit only five and a half years I don't have like a long credit age which is the one and only for the credit score might 9737 really I suspect it's because I bought a lot of rental properties yes I would imagine yeah cuz I was like crazy what optimizing it I haven't I would also imagine you probably don't have a lot of open lines of credit like you probably don't have a high credit to debt ratio you know I might like maximum balance is like I'm Amazon card and Fidelity card like increased but I don't have many cuz I don't know I just don't think I have like close to $90,000 in credit potential that I could I could spend on they won't give me any more I just I always kind of once in awhile try to help it but I log in the personal capital and I set everything up and I see this number it's net worth and then underneath has assets and liabilities and my net worth right now is $75,523 and I looked at that and said I feel shity should that feel shity or should that feel good knowing who I am and where I am and all those things well I mean to you you came from humble beginnings which I think there is there's something to say about that you are earning quite a bit now so that should perhaps factor into it but I wasn't so we we actually we actually have this article and average net worth by age and by 40 the average net worth for Americans is 35000 no way. Yeah but I don't so I'm above-average well maybe not older but I think based on your current income needs to be higher but I think yeah look first of all for many people like I have a buddy who earns an insane amount of his wife to a lawyer and no one's even more than him and collectively the two of them earn more than half a million a year but they have insane but they have insane amounts of student loan debt yeah whatever and it was like I want to say about a year ago he celebrated his his zero or were like his net worth was $0 not -12 years of working in the labor force probably 75 is good it's not 0k okay here's my question so I saw this number and I am looking at in this is just personal this is nothing to do with my it doesn't my business like does not factor into this is like I'm a paid employee of my own business so I get a paycheck every 2 weeks like anybody else and I have an investment account it's through betterment I have a Roth IRA regular bed in my account I have three credit cards for personal one-on-one I only use the sapphire Reserve but I have mine here there zero balance my car loan is not really alone because if the lease so it bounces out the zero every month after I pay it it's going to be technically it's a commitment that you made so you have to look at man and I have my house in in in South Jersey and what I was wondering was and I'm kind of like looking to you for guidance on this this number this metric right is this something that is my Northstar of basically being a a personal finance like baller you know like somebody who like values personal finance and end in once they've really have credibility in this in the industry but also like among other people is this the number that sort of look I just want to say I'm not sure we could ever get you credibility me where can I buy had what if I had 76011 die by the number but I think it most accurately represents what you're doing and and maybe a great example is you have this property but he living in and out of a mortgage and people but I talk too often focus on that the debt number like about this place for a hundred and I have 80 in debt and so now I have like 80,000 in debt and I just I can't deal with it it's like I'm not able to sleep and I think it was looking through maybe the wrong lens because you actually are positive and value and rice could you could sell that property in and have that liquid be home maybe not homes as quickly as say stop but you could do is your centrally using the debt to amp your assets which will and you're right so you're like tomorrow in at like 4% or whatever it is and then maybe your asset like your home on average a preciate 3% and if you're renting it out you're going to make even more so I think in lieu of like looking at death's which could just be depressing when I have an enormous amount of debt but net worth paying too much of a picture yeah I mean if you look at my liabilities there at $136,558 and that's all most of that is from my my mortgage the mortgage that I have outstanding and a little bit of credit card debt that I have for this month that will be paid off at the end of the month but it's there now right cuz we're in the middle of August when we recording this so that's a lot of debt and that that's really not going to go down unless I like aggressively pay off that mortgage and then the more aggressively I pay out that mortgage and I keep my ass at the same level that my net worth goes up right now cuz my assets are set at 212000 so if I aggressively pay down my mortgage which limits my liabilities that net worth goes up so this is sort of why is he doesn't so if you have like a hundred $1 property so you had like $100,000 and eighty thousand cash right now they took $80,000 of that cash you had and paid off but yet you still only have $20,000 that's assuming that I'm not taking the existing Cash's there to use it to pay down my my liabilities right I'm saying like any new cash that comes in from this point forward if I if I took all of my cash this from starting right now at $212,000 in assets and I took all new cast going forward meaning my paychecks and I put all of that money towards paying off my mortgage right hundred percent of that is going to increase my network app solutely obviously not as good cuz you wouldn't be my liability if there's interest on your debt but you know maybe the most ideal is like if your mortgage payment is good and you're okay with it and whatever you could take that extra cash and invest that cash the best it which could end up making you more and and she has to like compared to possibly do it those dollars maybe say 7% on average versus 4% you'd save paint so here's what I want to do I want to take like this number does net worth knowing you you know it's important right is it the only number or is it or is it like now that I'm in this position where I have no credit card debt I have me know I'm at is this the new metric that I need to pay attention to and are there other metrics depending on the situation that you're in as you know going through your personal finance you know is is that the magic number first right I feel like whatever and then and then a question like that the answer is like a life or will you know that's a lie but the answer is no you know we also do you have that do you have this available to you that you is this your Northstar number mine is become more complicated to figure out what I that it's pretty much the only number that I personally used to determine how I'm doing financially based on my expectations and anything else I feel is a little diluted like I have an enormous amount of debt yeah but I mean where is it at where is it at what words that that the properties so I'm property so in the home that I live in I'm in my rental properties and you summon up you probably just like vomit amount of but if you only saw that number yeah right that's not the entire story exactly and so sometimes I get into the Weeds on specific issues but you don't know if you're doing good net worth is is like it I think it is the North Star for me at least okay so I want to take a break real quick and I want to talk about you know how to manipulate that number in your favor so I'm looking at this number now and I'm saying there's a lot of choices I can make to improve that number right n n n I want to be smart about those choices but right now that the way it looks to me is like the fastest route to doing that as paint is getting a liability to go down so it's tender and hotels and we will end your network you know when you're in. Yeah right when we come back we're going to amp my net worth right here live Andrews just going to venmo me at my network I said I do with my $10 heard it here first folks so Andrew and I we have course run these online businesses and those businesses rely heavily on search engine traffic specifically Google of course and if you're interested in building this type of business like us you're going to need some help and Andrew you turn me on to the stool many years ago but more recently I've been using it for the past year that school is a 8hr efs.com yes it is a suite of SEO tools for keyword research and website optimization and I want to ask you what is there so many Tools in a what's your favorite one well so it's not as a good question yeah one of my favorite for the longest time a keyword research is almost cheating but they have this tool call content Explorer initially know how to use and then I was like okay I want to find everyone else who is mentioning fundrise I just want to find the highest articles that rhyme for fundrise so I could just do it better so I search fundrise sort by descending traffic volume and am done now I have all my ideas of that that's the internet promoting fundrise wow that's awesome it is been very lucrative yeah I don't know if I have a favorite but I definitely love that just a site Explorer in general like where you can literally type in any website on the internet and find out all kinds of information like what the organic search traffic what keywords they rank 4 and just sort of yo do some competitor research is great and I used it for some University of using from other sites it's been excellent and here's the deal if you're interested in using HRS for yourself and for your business to build a business to use it for your existing business you need traffic if you need to have the Apple visit your website I think this applies to you yes you can actually win a free light annual subscription by tweeting all you do is tweet at h r s and at Money Matters man telling us why you want to win this free h r s account also if you didn't catch any of this ad don't worry the directions will be in the show notes for this episode so visit Ace raps.com and there are few of these ads every ad that runs is a free account that's being given away so if you missed last week's do it again very big o h raps.com alright I got the van though it's in my account okay now I'm at 7 $75,533 thank you I don't know how personal capital you know did all the math in and internet connections to make that work but here we are so yeah I'm using my personal situation I'm staring at I'm staring at my my net worth and I'm like okay how do I take that $75,000 up to me where do I wanted to be that's a question like you know I said that to you I said is 75 good you said based on the average it's the average is like 35 or something at 40 years old which I'm not yet as much as you want to believe that I am that is that is the average but I think that you should be like we should focus on the above average all right is there a specific number goal I should be I should be like striving towards I actually get this question a lot from friends who say you know where I'm 35 I'm 37 I'm whatever age how much should be in my stomach how much should I have in cash right now or how much I have invested right like they want to know how much I should have saved for retirement and I actually don't know the answer to that I mean loose off the top of my head so now they're there was something that I honestly have kind of uses personal litmus test see if I'm doing good there's this guy right he created the financial Samurai my name is it was a big inspiration for me when I was like first starting my website right kind of resonated with him a lot and now he has an article that the willing to it's the average net worth for the above average person average things out new low maybe can trust me with it I wanted something more aggressive as we as like for older Savers or low-end income middle Savers or mid-end income and younger Savers are high in income and I guess younger Savers meaning you started early yeah a lot of money he bases it on the number of years worked how many years have you worked map well technically I've been working since I was 13 but you're being is true but if we're behind like I actually working I was at a dinner table when I was six and not getting paid for it just want to put that out there so I had him via right now I know I was working in an actual place to get a paycheck at 13 but I don't know how I was sorry I was possible child labor we only work the weekends and I spent all my money what you said I get our paychecks used to walk across the street to Wachovia Bank at the card cashed it and then our parents to drop us off at Walmart which is newer the time and we used to spy on hot dogs cap guns Bubblegum and just blow our entire $70 at Walmart. Net that weekend so my full-time started working I was in high school so I was when I was 17 I could draw 17 hot dogs I'm Slimer I've had too many hot dogs we just fall right through so I had a full-time job at a car car payment all that stuff so 17 getting a paycheck all that I 310 1318 years on the low and you should have a 200000 shit I'm a mid-engine F-550 and the high and he says 750 of 13 years experience or roughly the same age I think that I 39 account like after college graduated college I was working while you're in college and more years then I want a reality I know but I made Three fatty Hi-5 someway underwear I should be yeah I think so okay alright attention to that low number the highest number the VIN number what do you think I should I should fall into whatever this is not to say anything but I think you should focus on the low number because first of all like if you can meet that number then you aren't above individual first of all at 40 so 40 is roughly 18 years of working okay okay so so I have 5 years in a lot of people because I cuz I didn't go to college and then I guess you just didn't do much of that 40 the average now wear this 35,000 which feel like they're like how can I relieve I'm ready to start working on it like sorry not sorry so for some reason these is reasonable show you some that I'm not that's all I'm about $75,000 off so I need to double my net worth in tell me how you would cover that ground knowing use my example like knowing who I am just be like do another product urbino sell some sponsorships for this podcast like that's not everyone can do that so what would you do if if it was earlier in this episode you're bragging about your credit score what it what are you doing I'm sorry I'm sorry what do you use it when he died yeah you have you have credit that's going to be on my Tombstone his credit score was the only the only man who can get over the 8:40 limit he he wrote this Tombstone himself and I can have access to the bottom like we do not guarantee that he made so so so what is a great word so yeah what do I do when I would ask what credit score fine what do you mean you that you mean by some shit so so yeah in terms of income rental properties with good income from it but something that I didn't really plan for or honestly give a shit about and I'm kind of whatever about now is is like we've only engaged and deals that before we even started like on the books looks like would be over 20% cash and cash a year so like 20% return a year or more than that before you even get started on these vacancies and obviously the number comes down so say say like you have like a terrible for you and your in like you start with over 20 and you're ending it like 15% of your gaining in cash that's great that money goes into your bank account can increase your net worth but then the icing on the cake not added into the number is appreciation and Laura and I have four properties this time and inadvertently you knock knock through planning like an enormous amount of the growth has come through appreciation and so I'm not saying like so the only way to do it is through properties that can grow and either using cash that you have or in this kind of I was like poking at your credit score leveraging like your Highland ability to earn more because like so say it only takes you ten thousand down payment for a property and then the rest is essentially your credit UB you just amplifier like it's like a cheat code yeah but that would mean I'd have to buy property and rent it out so and alternative obviously they will be the best if you go and find your own property and do all that I mean cuz you keep all of it on average fundrise for us has been a little over 12% there are there like medium to your deals like Vanguard rates are competing. Space they need much bigger things because it a lot of money you know and it's not like in the 100 $200,000 property means that we would compete in the kind of middle area you know what you got to get like the best of both you get like a higher yields you don't you're not like that it's extremely low touch not as great as if you're doing yourself but far better than the not doing let's assume I don't want property because I have a piece of property here that is appreciating but it hadn't appreciate it in 10 years in fact I bought it for 180 when it was worth 180 and it's not worth 150k it's been 10 fucking years it has an appreciate it at all ever I'm a little skeptical in the housing market what happens if I'm waiting for the top of the market right now and I'm like yeah it's been 10 years I'll do it again and then I get my ass handed to me again what's another alternative to to like boost those numbers without buying rental property or investing in something like fundrise which personally like I don't know nothing about how to say that's not good but honestly like I've I don't know much about it I would I would surmise your costs and I'd say in like two ways one so your net worth a 75 but your assets are too whatever and so there's a gap in there that's and debt has a cost and so any easy way is to optimize that right to lower the debt like the cost of the Dead is the interest rate so if your interest rate was 3% versus 20% you know ya up to okay so right now I can tell you that my Mortgage Debt or my mortgage interest is 4.5 4.5 yeah I thought about this I have this mortgage that I'm sitting on I paid 10 years into it so I have 20 years left in the mortgage right I'm still paying a shitload an interest not a lot in principle a couple of things have come up that I've been thinking a lot about one cuz that cuz like to me that's that's what's really causing all of the liabilities all the liabilities are in this mortgage wish you would have refinance like to 3 years ago so I did do it I did a streamline refinance which ended up bringing my interest rate from 5.5 to 4.5 so I dropped it a full percentage without increasing the length of my loan so I'm still paying the 30 years as it was day one but my interest rate went my interest rate went down by 1 Point Mountain Dew any like yo check into the property like it was all over the phone one day I was like yeah I'll take the point but now I'm Like a Man 2 no I mean I know it's paying over $1,500 a month my mortgage and now I'm closer to 14 but I was thinking there's a few options right I could take all available cash that I have instead of investing it into betterment let's say I could be investing it into paying down that debt right I'm just saying it's an option I saw your face it's an option the other one was what if I refinanced and brought it back up to 30 years and now my monthly payments are lower but at least with my monthly payments are lower I have a rental property rental incomes coming in and it'll actually give me a little extra cash to may be paid on the mortgage faster I don't know so so yeah that were sell the goddamn so 3 oz of random rental property that I have not actually it was that details but I remember so I guess I would if I was you I would wonder like it is a cool area what I want to live here is their value here well it's it's a nice brand new property brand new property as much appreciation I would say the the mortgage is just the cheapest money as a person you will get except for an auto loan which is right say we diprimas was late your cache on fire because so so meaning meaning the interest rate is the lowest I'm going to get as a as a loan to the best opportunity to a melodic of court right answer the question is this mortgage and what is it going towards so over the long-term you will certainly pay more if you refinance to a fresh 30-year yeah you will then start to take money in a month because of the rental income right right as part of it are you going to lose equity I don't know how I know I thought you know I don't know yes I know you know refinancing is just like basically getting a new a new loan for the amount of the houses worth right now over 30 years again so I mean so it would significantly reduce the price that I pay a my mortgage per month however it's back to 30 years all of this because so I think like intrinsically it's like a really like interest we everyone's like no don't do that's a terrible deal however if you are in a home that was underwater and you lost your job whatever you know in 2008 2009 you might have sold your home and lost money just to stem the bleeding like just you know make yourself and so it's a lot of my friends bought at that same time cuz we're all the roughly the same age and I had people who did I had two friends who did short sales which I don't want to do also can't do because I make too much not I'm not trying to brag it's they literally won't short sell my house cuz I like both technically you can afford both places like oh yeah but I decided I would say I would optimize for cash flow so I would bring him or cash right because I did the day look who gives a shit you're not going to be out of your mortgage for 23 years 30 years why babe what difference of me and the point from my view is not to be over with the mortgage the point is at the highest return for my cash to grow my network with the fastest and so I think in your scenario if you were to make positive cash a month like the appreciation like whatever obviously but the bank's money is on the line anyways like I would do that so you're you're basically suggestion I'm looking at personal capital and I'm look I'm looking at my cash my investments my Loan mortgage whatever you're saying boost the cash number and what the mortgage is kind of go because in the cash number being make more money so you have it as an investment right investment is the money you make in the month I mean like is it the net value of the asset the net the net worth of gas it right so it's like how much is the property yield in terms of income minus like interest costs and then plus appreciation and depreciation will probably remain consistent to whatever it wants but if you can get some cash and then perhaps invest that into other things you know it's on hold time value of money thing cash today is worth more than cash tomorrow rat and so typically you like you're saying I should be investing and other things and not investing in pain down my mortgage I just want to be really clear that this is a home that you are not living in is a rental property and so that makes a stupid decision to yeah because I mean just isn't right right yeah it's a utility it's it's a roof over your head expense yeah yeah and it's also but no now it's me it's a bit to me it's a burden but it is it is positive positive about 15 15000 and it's clearly as long as the the zestimate doesn't go the other way and I'm going to continue to pay down my mortgage which I do every month like those that numbers that that Gap is going to widen which is going to increase my net worth over time being a 4.5% you know the cost yet that you could Guild more with the cash that you're sucking out if you reduce your monthly costs right and then take that cash put it towards something like betterment literally any other investment ultimately I'm losing 4.5% but I could be gaining seven to 12% in other places all right so you know and as you look at this number like it's it's really like I always say this to people it's very easy to take away you know it's very easy to look at a number like 75 and see that show the potential is 200 and so all I have to do is lower the liability number and I'll it'll it'll Goose my net worth right so very easy thing to do and it's less risky to do that cuz you're paying down debt risk is return so you know I have to take some amount of risk to make any amount of money right so I could go the other way with it and say well you know I have this available cash I'm about $4,000 sitting in a checking account I could take that money throw towards betterment and that would also as I can increase my net worth but it could increase my net worth faster than to betterment cast remaining no I wouldn't do that obviously is worth saying that like it is super important that you keep that they're just that's like your buffer from like shit go because I think a lot of people I mean included want to get like every like far too much risk Azrael yeah which is why that money still sitting there it's sort of a buffer for me and it's not a lot. Huge buffer but it's just there and it's kind of always there because I have my automation set up till like automatically investing in betterment every month and to automatically pay my mortgage payments and you know those things are all taken care of and so that number kind of just sits where it is you know and if I have to do sit I could obviously pay myself more for my own business or do you know in the in the case of like getting a raise at work or you know waiting for the bonus to come in or your tax returns or whatever but yeah there's really ultimately what I should be doing it over to Goose my net worth at least from this conversation is limit my expenses so that you have more cash brighten and use that cash to put into an investment of some type so so yes and I want to maybe like pulled back to just the overall tracking aspect or perhaps just like high-level looking at it because yeah like one like it's a litmus test for like how well you're doing right and there's room for growth and so you can have like action plans like you said it's like growing but like toys like personal Capital also like provide you with the opportunity so we're talking about costs and I I know are you said you do have a 401k no I have a Roth IRA and a 401k you know they have like a tool to help you optimize the costs in your 401k and often there's no correlation between high cost and high performance and so if you were to say take your fees from like 2% to like 1% over time you dramatically improve your net worth just my line flipping that switch in terms of net worth tools I feel like they have a lot but you had a pair of those snow another free and then like that's what Bloom does right bloom bloom all the help you like get your your phone case out of the shutter so I don't have that but if I did like that that would be helpful that for you like a lease in the ira side of things that they should have optimizing as you go right so right now I think like investment wise there's nothing I can really optimize besides lowering my expenses and I know you said but and then I bet I suck my teeth like that I guess the one thing is like sitting net worth this is arbitrary number. Like I was going to be higher not at the expense of all things and in the question is like to what extent and chances are you're in this like set up while you're learning now and then at like say 6065 you will not be earning earning in a much limited capacity drawing down on that bed net worth right and so retirement calculators like ones that don't suck that are actually like super hardcore use like Monte Carlo simulations and blah blah blah are super helpful and like determining like is your net worth okay because at the end of the day I don't know like maybe you spend $30,000 a year and you aspire to go just live in the woods in Alaska like all those bumps and movies you know and you don't need a ride and then you're on track and you could use a tool to essentially make sure they are on track to that goal so while like you know we talked about the average in the US and they like the quote unquote like above average individual average that's not good that's not a good thing in America average average in anything personal finance is never good right and so if you could grounds the net worth in like a specific goal of like what you want or need you don't obviously will change right. You account for that then at least you know you're on track but if I want to be a billionaire playboy at you know 65 I'm way off track consider starting like a personal finance website or something to look into it I'll see what I can do alright well dude I just kind of a this episode was sort of want to talk about that were think we absolutely covered it and its importance but I also kind of think this was a glimpse into what's been going on with me for the last three years since I've been absent from the show so we could probably Loop this into you know this financial life at the same time with Matt privacies net worth not-so-good pregnancies please delete the future episode so that we that you think we should have talked about this episode when it comes to you no tracking and paying attention to your net worth you know join listen Money Matters community on Facebook and will continue the conversation there you can just go to listen Money Matters.
