HowToShortRippleWhenItsDonePumpingEp227
what's up guys scrotum Sukhoi Nashville TV Friday TGIF Edition we are back we finally have something to talk about in the crypto markets how exciting is that so we're going to talk specifically about Bitcoin in Ripple today for all of you Ripple fans out there I can't tell if this thing is like a bot for more people are just that fired up about it whatever it may be a good news for people out there potentially at least in the short-term what's going on why is that what you can do about it and then I want to end with one of my favorite anecdotes great books reminiscence of a stock operator which I think you guys will find very good will like it alright so let's just don't forget to subscribe to subscribe button hit the thumbs up buttonyes crush it all links in the description sign up for the newsletter everything great stuff what do you pick on we've had a really good run and did you guys told you what I'm doing which is dollar cost averaging for the two weeks or so that's been my Approach of an out of only done it twice right action only executed twice but as far as I'm concerned until we get out of the this kind of lower higher look like this consolidation accumulation whatever it is I'm not really interested in looking at Bitcoin as a trending Market that is why I'm just a dollar cost average but goes down it goes down if it goes up it goes up but I'm not focused on that that's how I'm playing at other people maybe playing a differently special people that are trying to do the short term scalping swing trading things like that I'm receiving some some really good juice some really good progress It's coming out if you look at a longer time frame so if anybody listening on the podcast myself over you guys to see the prices if you're watching you can see that we are obviously having some sort of consolidation and we are holding this support line above 5806 thousand and we're bouncing off of it the next big test is going to be if we can get above this 7500 area and then I forget about 7,800 that's when you start to see the actual momentum-shifting is not just a okay well now we're in a sideways pattern instead of a downward pattern so I'm just watching this I'm taking it pretty slow and just accumulating just slowly accumulating I don't care if it goes up for goes down that's the way I'm playing it because I think pick one still got a lot of price Discovery like 1 days to move Polish news comes out the next day it's the most Parish news and this is not really no it's not the game I want to play at this point with big one but let's talk about what's going on in the overall market now you can see that is zoom in here to the one-hour unsurprisingly in Sochi with a dominance if what if and when Bitcoin goes up so is everything else have to go to the coin market cap you can see that in the last day 2 days for anybody's been watching we've had some pretty significant pumps most specifically with ripple which is now number 2 on coinmarketcap that's opposite for debate I get it some people look at the total market cap versus the available Supply sell cuz you know I was doing the tokens and Red Bull and see it was Stellar it and how you measure it but for all intensive purposes let's just look at that and if you look at the chart I zoomed in here to 5 minutes so you guys can see what I'm looking at I'm just looking at the Bitcoin I'm sorry the Ripple Bitcoin five minute and you can see I mean how many time have we seen this this shaped curve I mean whether you're on the one minute whether you're on the daily I mean it's it's the same thing over and over and over now I'm not saying I don't know what I actually think we're both but I think from what I've talked to people and people I've met who are connected to the Ripple truck company are they were 26 billion dollars he can't even measure market cap based on token value that's all up for debate in my opinion but all I really care about is what is this chart look like because that's all you can really do in the speculative markets and so what did Charles looks like well this looks like a pretty classic bubble if you ask me it is slow accumulation of bomb another accumulation of bump bump all the way up to his blow off top and now right now we are printing the second kind of oh no it's not done yet let's see if I can pump it up again maybe maybe this is the beginning of a new Bull Run and then we go from there could this continue to blow up great but these are this is a difficult game to play it and it's hard to win over the long term but if you do it right you can make a ton of money so if anybody who has been that hats off to you so we'll see how this plays out now here's the most important part I think that this is what I want to make why I want to make the video the question everybody asks on Twitter telegram slack Discord wherever you're hanging out why is this happening so you can I look through a bunch of Articles this is just a classic one to go to coindesk and you talk about this is actually isn't even very new but this was yesterday evening nepc comes down to all those news coming out about their potential Integrations about their potential the rail system X rapid now that I believe they have a conference at like this is all the stuff that you know anybody who's been in a crypto for a year or two years and I don't consider myself by any means like a full expert on this stuff but I do consider myself much more well-versed than most people because I spent all my time dissecting this Market other markets seeing how it all works together and what I have learned is that the news like this is a convenient way to justify something that nobody really knows what's going on are very very small group of people know what's going on and that is why in my opinion you just can't trust news you can't trust announcements one you're talking about multi-billion-dollar moves kid that dude there's something much bigger going on behind the scenes that nobody really knows or at least they don't know yet and maybe they will down the road but especially when it comes to this kind of price action it's so what I would what I want to do is talk about my personal opinion about one potential way this could be going down okay now I I personally really think that I would be remiss if I didn't said if you did want to trade this obviously going to exchanges you can do a lot of things but this is this the kind of situation where I think Leverage is helpful right where you can go on some like that a lot of people have don't they don't like the next for whatever reason I mean it's so you don't have your own opinions but this is a really good reason when if you do want to take some sort of you know you see the momentum flying up and you would do want to get that leverage on bitmex this is when you can ride the wave where the much smaller amount and yes the chances of you losing that amount or smaller but these parabolic moves this is one Leverage does get interesting because you kind of get in and you get out without really getting burned you your risk app luck me a lot lower now to see if it Mexican offer Ripple Ripple restaurants I think this is a good situation where if you're going to trade it you got to look at the contract day to apply want to treat the December 28th professional or not but I told the extra for the Futures contract expires on December 25th not September 28th because September 28th if you have sucker position or whatever you only have 7 days to close it out December gives you a few more months so however you want to play it or if you go any buy a bunch on binance you can come on you can come on Big Macs and you can hedge your Bets with 1/5 of the position and go short so if you kind of offset your potential losses so to speak so this is just the kind of thing that if you're going to trade if you're going to mess with this kind of thing have a plan bitmex is a great place to have that plant in my opinion it is not actually not as good right now it's it's pretty good at something like binance but it is really good but the premium on the price is a little so check it out when I should I come forward slash bitmax because I do think that that's a smart trailer to do it's not speculate it's not crazy it's just that's what that's what you do when you have a when you want to make a strategy out of it here's what I think I know people are going to disagree with me on this some people are going to think this is bananas that's twice I've used bananas now it's not banana down chill out does a great book reminiscence of a stock of talk about talk about this may times I would recommend everybody check that book out supposed to be interested in how whales and Market operate within people who have a lot of money but here's a story this is not exactly how it goes down the book paraphrasing Jesse Livermore who's the main character I believe it's him get to tip that there is a stock is about to go way down so he's all fired up and he goes into one of his is brokerage and he goes to the top Speculator and he says hey man I got a hot tip this company is about to go way down and the Speculator looks and him look for the tape looks back in him and walks up to the trading desk since it's okay start buying it and Livermore looks at me like dude I just told you it's going way down like this is very very good information white why you buying it looked at him the tape and he says keep buying more Livermore what are you doing dude this is it saying why are you buying a stock that you know is going down that they traded stocks obviously back in the 1959 twenties that'll turn the century type thing corrective action as soon as guys buying and buying and buying and then he stops and then he sits there and he just starts to just looks at the at the ticker tape tape which of the boards the writing up in shock or whatever and look for more psych dude you just bought all the stock of it's it's going to be you're going to lose so much money and then the spec it looks it in so I can tape it turns a broker goes okay how much you could sell 5000 stock 5000 shares of stock Brokers like OK goes and sells it and when he sells it he sees the price start to move down briefly more so than I would have on something that was bullish so this is a tail to the Speculator it says okay now that there is all this new people that rush in because the Sami bidding up the price all these new people came in and bought up all these all these years but the underlying momentum the underlying forces on this stock are still bearish it's still going to go down with the the speculative created all the liquidity underneath it Tony C's this kid turns around and goes back to the the broker and he says okay sell all the stock and then sell an extra hundred thousand shares short Asperger's leg white seated bought up however many however much because the Speculator knows that he just create an artificial liquidity pool where he can dump all this shares and he knows that the momentum is going to go lay back down but he needed to do that in order to test the market and also to dump all of his stuff and lo and behold he should he sells all the shares stock starts to go down way faster than a normal stock would because it has that very short selling underneath it and it just collapses in the guy makes a ton of money on the shares that he sold short you're right I had a very good idea it's no problem because I had a very good idea that you were right about that stock but I could just go out and just start shorting it I needed to make sure and see what he did is he went out and he created a big enough position where he could test it he can make sure that if you did sell it it would move the whole Market down and that's what he did I do not know if that's what's happening in Ripple right now I have no idea who's buying who selling I don't know how many different counselor or whatever but what I do know is it there are there are not a lot of different strategies out there that market makers in Market speculators use when they have a lot of money if you have I don't know 2550 hundred million dollar position in a coin and your both of your barishan it maybe you know something that other people don't know you're like a lot of people think that that's a sign that you should sell it but in crypto that's actually a sign that you should start pumping it because if you don't pump it you can't dump $59 worth of say Ripple or whatever is your coin is card I mean any of the coins out there you can't jump in the market if there's no liquidity so you need to pump it first knowing that it's going to go down at some point and then attempt again I have no idea this is what's going to happen with ripple all I know is it that is a that was a very very good story from the book and I've seen it happen over and over and over and over again in markets like this and when I see articles like on coindesk we're just two kind of like trying to make up reasons why this is happening it becomes more and more clear to me that somebody is trying to make it happen in as we're watching this in real time it's just it's it's dumping right is following the exact level chart look at the volume to liquidity pool that was created and if we had any sort of data science or we could find a way to see how many addresses could count for all of this I bet it would come back where there's a handful of addresses that dumped a lot of Ripple right at this right within this top. so it's a it's a it's just good to know how these games are being played and you can draw your own conclusions I hope you draw your own conclusions and you don't listen to some random dude in the internet about whatever but these stories are tried-and-true so bottom line with Bitcoin continue my plan dollar cost average I'm not going to chase it I'm not going to freak out of a dumpster if it pumps I don't care I'm just going to keep going. Cost averaging for the foreseeable future if you do want to if you see more of these altcoins go up start the pump start to look like they will pump in my opinion I think the best way to do it is you can buy it on someone like binance or a picture X or wherever you're treating your your spot coins and then have the Hedge over on something like that Max right where you can use leverage any very smart way so that you're not totally exposed and you can go short with a leveraged position it's much much smaller than what you're actually buying on the spot exchanges and finally always question why things are happening because it markets you got to remember somebody's always winning in somebody's always losing if you don't know who that is chassis you know I mean Marcus don't it's it's trying to take all your money so you know you just gotta remember that at all times markets are always trying to take your money at they are not friendly in that way and so you always want to be asking yourself what is who's on the other side of this trade what's the motivation I hope that helps this week I've actually recorded a bunch of videos that I will publish probably next week about how to get started in things like Equity stocks Futures I've ever wanted to like just hey here's what is what it is you had to get started to do I did a bunch of videos on did next that I think would be really helpful for beginners what kind of squash of to a bunch of look over 200 extra money that's just frankly that's what I thought at first and now it's very ignorant of me to think so I want to clear the air I'll put that up next week couple of them out there hopefully to help you guys out in the meantime I hope you have a great weekend yes crush it I guys have a great weekend peace out
