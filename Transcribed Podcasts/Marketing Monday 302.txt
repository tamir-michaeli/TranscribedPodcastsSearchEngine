Marketing Monday 302
walk me to the marketing Monday. Cam live broadcast my name is Dean Jackson and this week I'm coming to you live from Chicago we just got here on the weekend for fixing to do the main event today on Tuesday and Wednesday and then fly back to work so I'm pretty excited about that last week if you turned in we were talking about how to Target for Market how to choose a specific Target Market in this week I said that we would talk about how to Corner the market on listings and that's what I want to talk about this week when you first start thinking about targeting the market let's use the townhouse example that we used last week what we've got to do first is realize what we're working with you even when there's a 10% turnover rate which is sometimes rare that still means that 90% of the people who were trying to communicate with our completely uninterested in us they have no interest whatsoever that they're not interested in selling their house they're not it's not on their radar they're going about their life what our goal is is to find that six or seven or 10% of the people who are thinking about selling the house at just the right time now you probably are aware of this but you know that people don't just wake up one morning and decide honey let's sell the house call A realtor put up beside right away very sort of slowly people go through a process of making a decision that you know what I think we need a bigger house or I sure would like to get into this particular new subdivision or you know we're having the baby and we're going to need more room or we were making more money now we can afford a bigger house as lots of reasons why people decide to move the examples I'm giving might be applicable to people in town houses for the real motivation that people have starts months ahead of when they actually take any action on this so their step one is to realize we're working with the only trying to attract the 7 or the 10% of the people who are actually going to sell their house in the next 12 months cuz that's where our opportunity as number 2 we want to choose to focus on getting rich vs getting famous not talked about this quite a bit and one of the biggest things that we have to do is fight that urge to make your marketing all about you you don't want people to know that we are the new specialist in town that we are the townhouse specialist Dean sells townhomes.com you know what the natural tendency and let everybody know it's funny because I offered at the main event do a exercise where I give people a choice I say if I give you a choice of the audience represents how subdivision and if I give you a choice of coming up here on stage letting people know who you are and help you get the word out about you everybody in the audience would know who you are or I gave you the chance of sitting down remaining in your seat and I would bring you a list and on that list would be the names addresses and the telephone numbers of the 50 people who own those town homes are going to sell in the next 12 months that would be much more valuable to you know most people end up choosing the envelope that it's far more valuable for you to know who they are is for them to know who you are specially at the beginning you know what we really want to focus on is that they're not looking to choose a realtor right now they're not looking to make a decision based on a postcard or based on an send a text just starting the process if we have the opportunity to get them to raise their hand what we really want to do is focus on what day what that's number 3 is focus on what those 7% really want to know what triggers everything for them you know what triggers them selling their house what's the first question that they have one there thinking about that process even if your house is probably on their mind they're probably trying to decide where it is they're going to Two Boots and that's often a great place to start but as far as selling their house goes the first question that they have is what what's my house worth that's the most basic question that starts the process that is the thing that is on people's minds they have a speculative idea of what their house might be worth they have they have a seahorse a idea of what their house might be worth from what other people are saying what they see other properties listed for the newspaper and what they hear other people got specifically clear on what their house might be worth and that is a big motivation so we really want to focus on is offering people the opportunity to really find out what their house is worth that's why in are getting listings program the thing that we focus on first is offering people and I want you to get the psychology of this because it's it's very different it's gone through an evolutionary process this getting listings program for years I've been trying to crack the listing code and offer people the opportunity to find out how much your house is worth for free over the phone which was a popular offer and it worked but it wasn't quite as good as for we moved to find out how much River Oaks home is worth for free over the phone and even that wasn't as good as what we finally settle for on here which is the free May 2008 report on Georgetown townhouse prices the reason that I believe that that offer is so successful is because it's not committing them to anything it's not committing them they're not feeling this sense of obligation like they're feeling if they were calling to find out and get a specific price on their house now we're going to offer to take advantage of that offer but the most response the spot for the most initially responsive thing we found is offering them the report on the local prices recency and so when people call for that you don't know what's they've raised their hand we got to realize that that's just the first step even after they raise their hand it's still not about you you don't we want to kind of focus on making it easy for them to get what they really want from buyers for home sellers I'm sorry typically want for big things they want help pricing their house they want to know what fix-ups they can do to their house to get the top price they want help finding a buyer and they want help with the paperwork they want somebody to help them with all of the details on the transactional details and that's really what we're doing is helping people find all four of those things now I want to encourage you to if you haven't already started is to get started with the getting master's program the results of people are getting on the message board really people are calling up and say when can you come and sell my home I just put a post up on me on my bar. Com showed all of the results that were happening from The Message Board and it's always very encouraging you know it's always very encouraging to see that people are getting results now if you're not started with that program yeah that's what I really want to encourage you to do today now it's going to give you a tour of what is available for you in the getting the best thing that I've ever developed for getting listings we start out we we talked about all five of the necessary components of a complete listing program sucks number one is getting listing leads to share with you a little bit about our concept there of getting people to just raise their hand and tell hey I'm much more likely to sell my house then somebody who didn't ask for this report and you know you'll find that what you're doing is generating this to people who you know are like to sell their house for the next 12 months that's a pretty big list of all of the names of the people sell their house now. Everybody to ask for the report will sell their house some of the movie curious about what their house is worth maybe for refinance purposes some of the meat just be curious but a good portion of them are going to be curious because they're going to be selling their house so once we've gotten people to raise their hand tell you that they're thinking about selling their house step 2 is getting listing appointments in order to do that we've created $12 newsletters for you which is a complete 1-year follow-up program which educates people all about things they can do to get a higher price for their house to prepare their house for sale give them ideas and tips on what kinds of things get the highest return on those Investments we've got a customizable book for you that you send out to people who have raised their hand called your house for top dollar fast and that's a booklet that you send out along with one of your your top dollar newsletters and a cover letter that I've already written and in addition that we've written 12 cover letters that go with the with the get top-dollar newsletter so you really just are putting the pieces together and each month after somebody raises their hand we continue to follow up with them until they call you and say it when can you come over and let's my house and that's literally what they do say that along the way will be making special offers so that people will have an opportunity for you to help them prepare their house for the market offering them our room by room review for them to find out how much their house is worth with are pinpoint price analysis and and the silent Market where they may be able to match their house to one of the buyers that you already have number 3 is Art is getting listings so once we get the listing leads once we get a listing appointment to next thing with you just to get listings and there's a lot of tools available for some fantastic dialogue tools that Joe has developed for us with to help us get 5-star listings that's all we're really looking for in this process if we can get 5 star listings of those are people who are motivated to move willing to price at market value willing to Stage the house to show it to best lose all the marketing obstacles obstacles reading the the dogs or the Clutter or the restrictive showing hours or we got to be there for people to see the house any of those things are obstacles and people were five star sellers are willing to remove those obstacle they're willing to get involved and help you find a buyer if we can find Five Star Cellars like that our job would be a lot easier than the biggest hassles in our business is when we take listings that are not five star Cellars people who are the house or at all willing to help that's a big frustration so that's where we overcome all of those obstacles in in Section 3 of getting listings for listings salt and listings are liability until they're sold so what we focus on is what needs to happen to get your listings Soul I've got a book for you included in in your getting listings materials called 37 ways to sell your listings in less time for more money in any market and their strategy after strategy after strategy of ways to find your own buyer the reality is that your biggest opportunity when you get a listing is not to put a sign up put your feet up and let somebody from the Define set that is the winning mindset is to think that you are in a race to find your own buyer for that listing you don't number what is you'll make more money if you sell your own listings and you've got a great opportunity to do that because you have complete access to the property you're the one who's the most motivated to find a buyer for that property you know the good news is if you do find your own buyer you'll be replacing your seller with your own buyer who is years from now going to be another seller summer setting this up for long-term domination there and then finally Section 5 of the getting the program is about creating a waiting list buyers who are looking to buy homes in that area and you know next week and talk about how to Corner the market on buyers for your specific target market and the reality is that you don't need listings to start finding buyers you know I often tell people to start in parallel start getting listings program and start the finding buyers program at the same time so that you are while you're finding people who are thinking about selling their house you are finding people who are thinking about buying the house in that area and it makes your job so much easier if you can just match people up so that's it for this week I can't encourage you enough to get involved in there getting listings program that truly is the easiest way to start dominating a specific target market and into next week and we'll talk about how to Corner the market on buyers for your target audience West Virginia game and I will see you next time
