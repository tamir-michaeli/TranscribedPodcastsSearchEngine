hello everyone I'm Greg Goins from the reimagine schools podcast a proud member of the education podcast Network just like the show you're listening to right now the opinions expressed are those of the individual host make sure you check out all the other great podcast at edu podcast network.com and get ready because the learning begins in 3 2 1 this is your source for the latest in Google for Education news tips tricks ideas and all kinds of things that you can use in your class tomorrow and today we're going to dig into the idea of eating portfolios a way that students can gather all of that information and all that work that they've done throughout the year and keep it with them and how Google sites works really well with gas Google site is going to be such a powerful tool to use for a portfolios we're also going to share our favorite Google news and updates of course we have some fabulous feedback even some voicemails were going to play for you and of course a couple of things from the blogosphere so you ready to get going that Google news and updates today talk about a way that Microsoft Office integrates with Google so if you have one of those situations where you have some Google things and you have Office 365 or something or if you work with Microsoft Office files this is for you so if you have Microsoft Office files in Google Drive now Google has this option where you can avoid version conflict so if somebody's working on one version of the file and somebody else is working on it a different time sometimes you have conflicts and now they're working through that they've got this thing called real-time presents but you're basically let users know if somebody else's editing a word file or an Excel file or PowerPoint file that's true that's stored in Google Drive and this is working through is there a Google drive file stream so this is supposed to start rolling out in October 17th so this is going to be one of those things that hopefully will make your life just a little bit easier it'll show you never do have those version conflicts it'll show you a side by side of what those two versions are and you can pick which one you want to keep I think this looks great of course you know I am not currently using the combination of of Microsoft and in Google together we have so many schools that are so I really felt like this was an important thing to include Microsoft updates so just drop by this by gmail which is been this like special sort of version of Gmail is not for a few years since 2014 its going away shut down by the end of March 2018 I am just really upset I use inbox exclusively the big update to Gmail I tried it and I adjusted so well to inbox and so I'm really sad I'm going to have to make some adjustments as well because just like the weather Google changes all the time so my own my personal Gmail account I used my personal Gmail account I use it through inbox in fact I was all the way back years ago when they did the invitation or how you could only get into it by invitation and so I opted into that and got it before it was probably available did you do that to it at first it took me a while I really did it first of course now that I'm all adjusted I've got to adjust is going to be later this year and so this this is not a feature that you're actually losing its now built into the new Gmail so much better than the old Chrome app people were using so if you're a g Suite admin for your teachers you want to go through the link and our show notes that will give you the directions on how to the Gmail offline and their settings and how to uninstall of course as an individual user you can go through and check this out, 58th and one last thing to mention the the whole idea of of Google Maps Google Maps street view and everything I think is such a useful tool and a classroom and it's interesting to see how it has morphed and so what what Google has started to do is to take the idea of those street view images on those Street and see what it actually looks like to be there and they're starting to use it to map out places that don't actually have streets like up in Canada for free basically or are going places by Novi snowmobile and a variety of other different ways they're starting to map out some of the places that are not so easy to get to and so Google's telling us about how they're doing this and if you're not familiar a lot of times with those street view images there's a car that will drive that has this panoramic camera on top of it will they've also created this thing called tracker where they'll they'll put this great big backpack on somebody's back that has a panoramic camera in it and I can gather some of those images in this post they also show a picture of somebody driving you know one of those great big tricycles with a with a panoramic camera on the back of it so it's interesting to see how Google starting to Branch out with asthmatic maps to show us more and more of the world from our devices so enough just another update that they've got to Google map of Canadian members in the tribe so we do is mapping the ocean floor North hey y'all we are going to talk about portfolios and more specifically how we can use cool sites to support that both for students and for teachers so if you're not really familiar with the idea of actually surprised we still put that in front of it he's over the years to Showcase work or to show growth or sort of like two sides two different types of portfolios attend to be the most popular and you know there's the Showcase portfolio which is really like your best work as a student on the teacher side a lot of teachers also use portfolios you know as resume but also as proof of some of their professional learning and things like that so it does allow us to make learning visible which obviously it's a very hot topic video of using Google sites to do this can make it very possible and you know Mathis ties back to so many of the ideas from the dynamic learning framework as well you know both getting students to publish to go beyond the walls and to get their work out their shared with the world as well as the idea of that you know continuous learning mindset and going beyond the bell and you know helping them to continue to work on things when the bell rings as soon as as soon as they are students are done with them and of course A lot of times they think whenever I get a grade on it and whenever I get it back actually a lot of times it's just whenever I turn it in then it's done and I'm done and I'm ready to move on and you know so often when we hand things back to students that ends up in the trash can because they don't have a good place to put it be there not motive made it to put it in place and see if they move on to something else but if we have something like an e-portfolio there's a couple of different models that that you can go with hear some teachers will create a portfolio of just their own students work so within the school year they're Gathering all of that work together and things that either they kind of like the one and done type of activities that were meaningful or maybe things that they progressively work on an ad to throughout the year and so you got that where it's just the student work within the school year but then some schools will also go with a an ongoing portfolio that follows students so they start on it you know either in elementary or middle school or High School Erwin whenever that may be and they just perpetually continually add meaningful things to it so it's an embodiment of everything that they've done so if your school doesn't do that and you think that that sounds meaningful up that might be something worth mentioning and trying to get started and even if you don't use students could create their own sites if they're bought into the idea to you might mention hey you got some really good stuff here if you start to collect it into a portfolio sorts then you can use that to see your grow throughout the year or maybe even to show it to somebody if you wanted to include a link on a college application or a job application or if you're trying to get in in a leadership position in an organization having some of that stuff that they can show can be really good and of course as we're building that that digital footprint know this is this is a way for students to put some of those positive things out there that they've done absolutely you know I've been a big fan of portfolios even before they were technically electronic my former School District even though a lot of teachers have been using still the older version of Google sites classic sites as you call it and classic site had the ability to to create and use templates so you can create a template that you wanted every student to you so that you can make sure they can molded it into the type of portfolio you wanted with certain pages in The Master school where class or something like that and that's one of the things were still missing in the new sites if you're using the new sites this means and more on the teacher in terms of creating the site and then sharing it with the student or possibly even with the really young you know publishing some of the work for them but in those upper grades I would say probably at least fifth grade maybe 4th grade and up the kids can easily do this because I would have never said that so with the new site if you really haven't looked at it it's it's beautiful and there were so many advantages to using G Suite in general for a portfolios that you know there's there's other things out there too and I still get a lot of questions about hey what's a good app for this Dewey portfolio canvas have like built-in things into their platforms for doing this so even if you don't want to jump into size hopefully you can take some of these ideas to use yeah I even remember I I tried to do something like this in my own classroom in my high school Spanish classes and at that point there wasn't anything like the new Google sites and so I was trying to use livebinders and each of the students I think had to have their own accounts and it was so much work to get something loaded in there and it was just it was such a a pain so I abandoned that but if we had something like Google site that is so easy to use it's it's drag-and-drop you know what's great about it is if your students are creating things with Angie sweet so they're making meaningful products in docs or slides or Google drawings or whatever really all they've got to do is just you can create sub Pages for different classes however you want to organize it for different projects and then all they do is just drag and drop a file from one of those any one of those G Suite apps you just drag and drop it under the screen and resize it and now there's even some of those little like mini templates that you can use that help you kind of like organize your your stuff on the page and and design it without a whole lot of effort and so by students being able to do that they're able to kind of like show the story of their work from start to finish or kind of like display what it is and yeah that the interface has has really come a long way and then in addition to that there's also sort of like the metacognitive side of it you know thinking about the thinking where students can write about the process in the Journey of creating those products they can even record videos and that they they dumped into the YouTuber Google Drive and then be able to display those on there portfolio sites to so really. The options are are pretty Limitless when it comes to this they are any of the advantage of using G Suite you know you've already got the accounts Roblox like what you were talking about with livebinders and you know everything just works so seamlessly together with all of those G Suite application so you know there's so many different ways that they can add that but really important pieces of any good portfolio is going to be that reflection peace dr. Johnston writing they open up you know the camera whatever their devices and they do sort of visual drawing out you know whether they're doing that in in drawings are making it some sort of representation of the things that first students actually go back to see hey this is where I was at the beginning of school and then to look at how far they've come to be able to make those connections is such a powerful thing that mess but honestly there's not enough this is this is an extremely powerful tool that that should should be in your classroom honestly I I think that is it is too powerful to ignore and like we said you know a no-brainer also included some additional links in the show notes for you and I found this great checklist for magic word yet and I will tell you this message from 2013 that don't let that deter you they actually had a really great list of things to think about that you may or may not want when you're when you're designing that the holy portfolio processed you know whether you want students to see each other's to comment and to do some of those other things so you know be sure that you come and check that out I also want you to be able to access we have a couple of examples in here for you thank you Mike Muhammad you had no idea that you're going to miss this episode but my presentation and he had his students creating some Physics portfolio they're beautiful gorgeous and it's it's so easy to do no Google sites just look so professional and I think it's just a really great way to model that whole perception for students and again it's something they can take with them when they go and that's a consideration to you know when you're trying to decide what tool to choose because it's specially with these older kids this is something that can help get them into college and you know so and we want to see what you're doing so if you're creating a portfolio for example yeah we definitely love to see that and if you got any tips and tricks if you've done this in your own classroom you said hey this really works or you know you probably ought to avoid this we'd love to see those too so definitely we love to see those on the Google teacher tribe hashtag on Twitter so that's GT tribe the hashtag GT tribe or you can always head over to Google teacher tribe. Com and send us a message and we'll gather some of those together if we get some good stuff we will pass on the next episode and if you want to see all of the resources that we've mentioned so far in these links to Mike's examples go to Google teacher tribe. I'm / 58 to grab a copy of the show notes there's a letter in your mailbox did you know what this is all your mail maybe I'll give you a call sometime mail alright drive it's time to hear from you so we're going to dig into the mailbag we get messages from you in a variety of different places and so we wanted to share some of those that have come in and his first one comes from Betty Jean France this was a comment that I was left on the website and what she says she's been using Google sites is next to what we were just talking about and what she wants students to be able to do is to offer a comment box you a place where someone can leave a comment on their portfolios or their student sites and she said she seen how some people will use Google forms to do this which is a pretty useful idea that idea is that you stick a Google form on to the students website and make some Fields where someone can leave a comment and then you take the spreadsheet where all of those responses come in and um bed that spreadsheet down below that Google form on a different place on the on the the page so then people are able to leave the comments through forms but then they can also see all of the comments that were submitted and she and so she was she was just asking you know is there another way to do this am I overlooking something she said if if if the portfolio kind of gets moved around is it going to become disjointed and honestly Casey I'm thinking this is probably just about the best option I can think of the only other thing I could think of is if you wanted to leave specific feedback for the student just teacher to student maybe you do that through an assignment in Google classroom but that's more of a private thing if you have private feedback but for public feedback this is about the best option as this is the most common that I have heard really one of the things I'm still waiting for in Google sites because publicly and globally comment that comment feature is really what changed my students thinking in terms of the value of their work it is it can't be undervalued how important that piece can be because the moment I know somebody's going to read it besides the teacher it just completely shift how they think about their work so but yeah and if anybody else has suggestions on ways you're making this work within Google sites or other places please share that with us okay we're going to move on to our next question which happens to be in Texas so it's Casey I feel like a little piece of my universe is back in place because you all are back on for the for the season you're my favorite podcast I wanted to say about Google Classroom the new class work page of the topics because I use my units of study as my topic you can move the whole topic up and down so I just keep the talk to you too that we're working on currently at the top of the page wonder if you could someone who's trying to add in a lot of materials that maybe don't go with the particular unit like the syllabus and all that I'm wondering if I need to make a hyper dog or something similar that had a link to all those resources and then don't topic that and then it would be the first thing on the classwork page and things would have access to all that other stuff they eat again so glad you have a great day too much did their mind topic for conversation are the frustrations with the classwork page and there's traffic so thank you for that suggestion of just sort of making a resource document that could go at the top are doing a suggestion on things are working for you inside that again please let us know I'm a proponent of more babies on the Google teacher tribe I'm not sure how we're going to do that but I think if there was a way to do it I think that I would be in favor of that so right. Everything okay Dan take it away from my baby in the background hear that just want to say thanks for the podcast book the course is all the stuff that you will offer free crochet doll quick question is what do you do if you're not allowed to download I guess or install the extensions that disintegrate extension Charlotte to use of high school a lot more locked if my point so I tried to try to have those by your system administrator and get those on block or what what is your suggestion of excess basically got it do you contact your system administrator in your school leaders I think definitely you do there's no real you know official work around I think you might be able to get into some like nefarious get around the system but I don't know that that's probably the best way but I think that's one of the important roles of we play as teachers is to be advocates for what's best for our students and so hopefully just by making those suggestions to the the school leadership about what we think will be best for students and hopefully in the end what's best for kids ends up winning out anyway so yeah I think that's that's probably your best option they're totally agree as frustrating as it is unfortunately the powers-that-be do not always understand what's best for kids and what's best for instruction and I really hate it when they don't trust seizures so I feel you man follow the protocol and and see if you can get some of those conversations on to our last question hear from Sarah fromhold who is a long time listener she's from Frisco Texas and Sarah asked if there is a way to make form responses go to the top of the response spreadsheet instead of the bottom agree with this because we didn't have any kind of answer somebody has written the script out there and so I did some digging and I did find one that was suggested in the Google product forums so I have link to that in the show notes for you so that was really the only way I can figure it out if somebody had to write a script and they're all kinds of Scrubs that people will write to do put a specific things like this in Google Sheets that link and see if that works by going to rci.com 58 list episode is just about in the bag but before we go we want to share a couple of blog post that you may want to check out some things that might be useful to you and I published one just recently at ditch that textbook about this thing that I'm calling Google Slides icon boards and one of the things that I love about using slides and drawings is that you can pull together text and images to create kind of like visual notes or almost like an infographic of the things that you're learning in the verbal visual mix is very brain friendly but sometimes going and finding all of those images can be a pain so I created a couple of templates that you can download here we're all of the icons and all the little arrows on all of those visuals that your students might want to use to create something kind of like an infographic or some visual notes is all sitting right there for you and all of those pieces are kind of like around the outside of the slide the drawing on that extra space on the outside so students can just kind of dragged them in I feel like it's kind of like infographics light or infographics for people in a hurry so all of the pieces are all kind of sitting there and you can just drag them onto the screen so there were some templates and there that that you can use if you want to check those out that's awesome yeah templates times are super handy and what a great way to do some some different types of visual thinking so thank you for creating and sharing that night episode our previous episode 58 where we talked about Google classroom and so if you Libby's question earlier about all about those updates and so from that episode and from teaching and online course with Google classroom and talking the teachers of talk to hundreds of teachers like what are you doing how are you what I found were there were five common ways that most teachers had decided to create those topics and how to organize those assignments so I put those into a blog post called how to organize assignments in Google classroom and you can go check out and see all five different suggestions with screenshots to see how to best organize for the type of of classroom that you have no and it's one of those things is going to be a personal preference grade level your content area and just like to work well that wraps up episode 58 of the Google teacher tribe so we hope everyone has picked up a few new Google tips and tricks especially when it comes to using my portfolios in Google sites you know I think there's just a plethora of ideas out there when it comes to this whole platform and how they make the most of my portfolio to help demonstrate student learning so you know the other thing to Matt I wanted to be sure and thank the listeners who have left us a
